"""mergeable(candidate) over EFFECTIVE state (spec §6.3).

Three outcomes:
  MERGEABLE  — every clause holds; the gate may write.
  PENDING    — valid so far but an expected approval/CI/release_order is absent.
  REJECTED   — a hard failure (bad sig, wrong signer, tier escalation, stale base,
               out-of-scope diff, policy/CI fail, aborted/superseded).

This module is signature-AGNOSTIC at the field level: it trusts that the gate has
already verified every event's signature against the public-key registry before
reducing (the gate does that in Task 14). Here we enforce the SEMANTIC clauses
(who signed, what tier, scope, freshness). 'repo' is any object exposing
rev_parse(ref) and changed_paths(base, head) — the real one is threeway.gitcas
bound to a repo path; tests pass a fake.
