"""The single authoritative cutover (Slice 2.5 §5c): preflight -> sign+append all
carriers in §6 total order -> backfill 6 cursors -> one authority-flip act. On ANY
append/cursor failure, tear down the partial events ref so no reader sees a half bus.

Consumes (never edits) the Slice-2 substrate: preflight_bus_init, RefEventStore,
advance_cursor; and the Phase-B legacy_projector + cursor_backfill. Pure composition.

API seam (verified at exec, diverged from the plan's snapshot): the Phase-B
`legacy_projector.project()` consumes the `sent/` directory DIRECTLY (not a coord
root), while `cursor_backfill` resolves `coordination/mailbox` from a coord root via
`_mailbox_base`. run_cutover takes the coord root and bridges the two: it derives the
sent/ dir from the root with the SAME `_mailbox_base` logic cursor_backfill uses, so
the projector + backfill can never disagree about which mailbox they are migrating.
