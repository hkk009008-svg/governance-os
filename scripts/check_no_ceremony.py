"""check_no_ceremony.py — forbid ceremony from the verification core.

CEREMONY = anything that produces the APPEARANCE of verification/enforcement
WITHOUT the substance: a green/PASS/verified signal that is NOT backed by
actually executing the check it claims to perform. The archetype (DECISIONS.md
ADR-027): wave_gate_check.py READS the inventory `status` string and runs zero
tests, so "GATE MET" proves only that a ceremony was logged.

This detector is the enforcement arm of ADR-028. It hard-fails (exit 1) on the
ceremony patterns it can detect with high precision, so new ceremony cannot be
introduced and the existing systemic ceremony stays RED until the routed fixes
(FIX-1 = gate executes pins; FIX-2 = CI runs --runxfail) land.

Rules:
  R1  xfail-strictness     every pytest.mark.xfail must be strict=True + reason=  (AST; prevention)
  R2  invisible-green      importorskip/skipif in a campaign *xfail*.py pin file that would
                           SKIP (dep genuinely absent) -> hard; dep present -> WARN (latent)
  R3  gate-executes-pins   scripts/wave_gate_check.py must EXECUTE the pins, not read status  [FIX-1]
  R4  ci-runs-runxfail     a CI workflow must run the pin suite with --runxfail               [FIX-2]
  R5  utv-not-a-row-status  `unable_to_verify` is a reviewer/operator VERDICT, never an inventory
                           row `status` — else it bypasses wave_gate_check blocking (ADR-027)  [ADR-032]
  R6  report-cites-exec-pin  a verification-report whose verdict is `pass` must cite an executed
                           `--runxfail` pin run in commands[] — a GO with no pin re-execution is
                           ceremony (the consumer re-runs it to detect fabrication)            [ADR-032]

This script never modifies anything and never relaxes a gate; it only ADDS signal.
It is NOT itself a status-reader — it parses/executes against live source.

Usage:  .venv/bin/python scripts/check_no_ceremony.py   # exit 0 clean, 1 on any HARD violation
