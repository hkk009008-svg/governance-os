# Three-Way Protocol — Canonical Architecture Diagram

**This is the canonical topology diagram.** It merges the accuracy of the Codex-drawn
flowchart with the visual styling of the Antigravity-drawn one, and corrects the errors found
in both (see *What this corrects* below). The **normative truth** is the spec
([`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-19-cross-provider-seat-topology-design.md`](../../superpowers/specs/2026-06-19-cross-provider-seat-topology-design.md))
and the `threeway/` package — consult them for any detail; when this diagram and they disagree,
they win.

> **Status:** this depicts the target protected-main topology. The `threeway/` package — signed bus,
> reducer, gate, RefEventStore, cutover substrate, and T2/T3 machinery — is built and hardened. The
> signed ref-bus is the load-bearing source for three-way facts, and T1/T2/T3 local CLI emission is
> proved against `refs/threeway/test-main`; the free-form mailbox remains the human coordination
> channel. Protected `refs/heads/main` deployment remains fail-closed until branch-protection/ref-ACL
> controls and a protected merge-gate runner are verifiable. See
> [`UNIFIED-OPERATING-DOCTRINE.md`](UNIFIED-OPERATING-DOCTRINE.md) §I.5 and
> [`MECHANISM-LEDGER.md`](MECHANISM-LEDGER.md).

## Legend

| Colour | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Blue** | Codex seat |
| **Orange** | Claude seat |
| **Black** | Mechanical / no-AI-authority role (overseer, CI, merge-gate, dual-chief apps) |
| **Dashed blue** | Antigravity — off every Layer-1 path |
| **Grey cylinder** | Bus / git artifact (events, branch, staging, main) |
| **Yellow** | Invariant annotation |

## What to notice (the load-bearing reads)

1. **Two-phase verification by the cross-provider operator.** The same operator attests *twice* —
   preliminary on `branch_sha` (step 3) and release on `integration_sha` (step 6) — with the
   coordinator's merge-only stage *between* them (step 4). Both attestations are **signed bus facts**,
   not point-to-point messages.
2. **Cross-provider independence.** Pair A: Codex builds, Claude verifies + integrates. Pair B mirrors
   it. A provider never primarily verifies or executes integration of its own work.
3. **The overseer SIGNS, the gate EVALUATES.** The overseer is a mechanical dispatcher that issues
   `cycle_go`/`release_order` but **may not issue a verdict**. The **merge-gate** is the sole evaluator:
   it re-derives the merge itself, refuses to trust the coordinator's `integration_sha`, and never runs
   candidate code.
4. **Two release triggers.** The gate fires only when **both** the coordinator's `release_requested`
   **and** the overseer's `release_order` exist (plus a PASS `ci_result`, the release GO, valid
   signatures, and an in-scope diff) — then promotes via exact-SHA compare-and-swap.
5. **Antigravity is not the dual chief.** The chiefs are Gemini Deep Think + ChatGPT Pro. Antigravity
   is an *optional* relayed-strategy app in the same lane (never the decider) or a read-only observer —
   off the candidate branch, staging ref, and protected `main`.
6. **The strategic loop is a loop.** Results feed the overseer's data→info summary, which feeds the
   chiefs, which return orders via the human relay — not a one-way chain.

## What this corrects (vs the two draft diagrams)

| # | Issue in a draft | Corrected here |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | agy labelled the chief node "Gemini/Antigravity" and called Antigravity "the Dual Chief" | Chief is Gemini Deep Think + ChatGPT Pro; Antigravity is a separate dashed advisory node feeding the human, never the chief |
| 2 | agy had the overseer "Evaluate CI+attestation" | Overseer only *signs* `release_order`; the **gate** evaluates |
| 3 | both omitted the coordinator's `release_requested` | Both triggers shown; gate needs both |
| 4 | both drew the strategic loop one-way | Feedback arc added (results → overseer → chief) |
| 5 | agy drew the preliminary attestation as a direct edge to the coordinator | Both attestations are signed bus facts |

*Provenance: corrected against `threeway/loop.py:43-52`, `threeway/predicate.py`, `threeway/gate.py`,
and spec §4/§5.1/§6.3/§6.4/§9, via independent three-lens verification of both draft diagrams
(workflows `wf_ec50f013-100`, `wf_335e4f5d-af5`).*
