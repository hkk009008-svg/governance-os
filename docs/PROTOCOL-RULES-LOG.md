# Protocol Rules — Emergence + Invocation Log

Tracks each codified rule's introduction (codification SHA + race that triggered it)
and per-session invocation count. Updated manually at session-close by operator
(or director, whoever wraps the session).

## Rule registry

| # | Rule | Codified | Race that triggered | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Role partition (director-only / operator-only / shared) | `ad6cb4f` | Session 6 shared-module pre-locate race | SOFT |
| 2 | Signaling narration (announce shared-task intent in chat) | `ad6cb4f` | Same race | SOFT |
| 3 | Git tiebreaker (first commit to land wins) | `ad6cb4f` | Hypothetical; documented preemptively | SOFT |

## Protocol Bundle v4.1 — Lane V refinements (cycle 6)

Codified during cycle 6 in response to operator's S13 Lane V
verification-report (`coordination/mailbox/archive/2026-05-24T17-24-52Z-operator-to-director-verification-report.md`) §v4.1 candidate
clarifications. Two operator-surfaced refinements shipped as v4.1
(mirrors v2.1's pytest-regex-fix shape):

**CC-1 — Lane V coalescing rule.** Operator MAY coalesce per-commit
Lane V dispatches into a single range-review when commits are small
(≤5), tightly coupled (same brief / shared contract surface), and
isolation-review would lose cross-system context. Strict per-commit
trigger remains the default; coalescing is operator discretion.
Empirical basis: S13's `feat(types)` + `feat(web)` commits were
correctly coalesced into one Lane V dispatch covering
`029dbf9..2fb44d1`; the cross-system review caught F1 CRITICAL that
isolation review of either commit alone would have missed.
Enforcement: SOFT

**CC-2 — Spec-reviewer hallucination mitigation.** General-purpose
spec reviewer observed (2/2 dispatches) to make confident
"X exists" / "X is required" claims that didn't survive grep
verification (dispatch #1: "module already imports os at top-level";
dispatch #2: "ReviewStage requires onRefreshProject Prop"). Both
hallucinated. v4.1 codifies: operator's spec-reviewer prompt MUST
include explicit "verify before asserting existence" instruction
requiring grep / Read verification of any symbol/prop/import claim
before inclusion in the report. If hallucinations persist after
CC-2 codification (≥1 more in cycle-7+ Lane V dispatches), v4.2
should consider operator's CC-2 options 2 (third lightweight
verifier subagent) or 3 (different subagent type for spec review).
Enforcement: SOFT

v4.1 ship SHA: `509db7c` (filled post-ship by operator per chicken-and-egg
pattern; mirrors `3e57ddf` v2 / `d8f2407` v3 / `d90036b` v4).

## Beneficiary distribution snapshot (Rule #11)

Per Rule #11 (codification bias check), every existing rule and every
future rule should have its primary beneficiary flagged. Retroactive
analysis for Rules 1-11, performed during v5 ship; extended to Rules
12-13 at v5.1 ship:

| Rule | Primary beneficiary | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (Role partition) | both | partitions work for both seats |
| 2 (Signaling) | both | both narrate |
| 3 (Git tiebreaker) | both | resolves races for both |
| 4 (State-asserting writes precondition) | operator-seat | catches stale handoff writes (operator-only territory pre-v5) |
| 5 (Race-acknowledging commit body) | both | both write commits |
| 6 (Counter-bump fold-and-surface) | operator-seat | counter bumps are operational |
| 7 (Pre-commit re-verify) | both | both commit |
| 8 (Mailbox authority) | user | closes user-as-relay bottleneck for both seats |
| 9 (Operator-side reviewer is independent) | operator-seat | enables Lane V |
| 10 (Joint-team mode) | both | discipline for both seats |
| 11 (Codification bias check) | user | reduces bias; serves principal's interest |
| 12 (Brief-level grep-the-writes discipline) | director-seat | constrains brief-writing (director-seat specialization); reduces Lane V cleanup for symbol-divergence (operator-seat benefits downstream) |
| 13 (Symmetric-endpoint audit discipline) | director-seat | constrains endpoint design (director-seat specialization); reduces Lane V findings for symmetric cases (operator-seat benefits downstream) |
| 14 (Operator-driven Lane B template + selection criteria) | both | enables operator-seat (codifies capability) + constrains operator-seat (5 criteria); enables director-seat (yield signal) + constrains director-seat (cannot claim operator-eligible work without explicit reason); symmetric on both axes |
| 15 (Cross-seat fix-on-received-findings convention) | both | enables both seats (codifies cross-seat closure mechanism that previously operated ad-hoc) + constrains both seats (formalizes disposition + commit-body convention); bidirectionally symmetric (operator-closes + director-closes) even though N=0 for operator-closes direction at codification time |
| 16 (User-direction without owner-spec) | both | symmetric obligation — either seat, whichever ships second, owes the ≤30min convergence event; complementary-parallel work is net-positive not redundant |
| 17 (Workflow-assisted analysis lanes) | both | director gains scaled blast-radius/impact analysis pre-Lane-B; operator gains scaled Lane S scouting + Rule #12/#13 audits; symmetric |
| 18 (Doc-maintenance verifier-scoped dispatch) | both | consolidation cost lands on operator (Lane D mechanical-slice carve-out; consent required + given bounded) + both benefit from kept-true docs; claim-edits stay senior-reviewed |
| 19 (Live-presence-over-inferred-idle) | both | both owe presence-file maintenance; both gain accurate peer-liveness; operator consented (REPLY `ab9925d`) |
| 20 (Shared-state-accuracy) | both | both seats' awareness gate recomputes truth; symmetric; operator consented (REPLY `ab9925d`) |
| 21 (Verdict-ahead-of-report) | both | either seat can unblock peer/user first and finish the fuller report after; also protects billed-clock user time |
| 22 (Flag-before-burn) | user | primarily protects user spend from unreviewed fee-burning scripts; both seats benefit downstream |
| 23 (Lane ownership and cross-lane ADRs) | both | preserves both lane boundaries and requires sign-off for cross-lane architecture |
| 24 (Live-seat mailbox-first) | user | closes missed-mail/user-as-relay gaps; both seats gain fresher routing truth |
| 25 (Codex seat-index HEAD-drift guard) | both | protects every live Codex seat from stale-index staged-scope corruption |
| 26 (Protocol-learning persistence) | user | preserves user-principal protocol improvements as durable state; both seats benefit from reusable learning |

**Distribution snapshot (2026-06-16, post-Codex protocol hardening):**
- `both`: 16 (Rules 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 25) — symmetric disciplines
- `user`: 5 (Rules 8, 11, 22, 24, 26) — close gaps in user-supervision, spend protection, and durable protocol learning
- `operator-seat`: 3 (Rules 4, 6, 9) — operational layer where races occur
- `director-seat`: 2 (Rules 12, 13) — constrain director-seat's specialization work
- (was 13 both / 2 user / 3 operator-seat / 2 director-seat = 20 at cycle-17; Rules #21–#26 add 3 `both` and 3 `user`; total **26 rules**)

**Prior snapshot (cycle-17, post-v5.7 ship):**
- `both`: 13 (Rules 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20) — symmetric disciplines
- `user`: 2 (Rules 8, 11) — close gaps in user-supervision
- `operator-seat`: 3 (Rules 4, 6, 9) — operational layer where races occur
- `director-seat`: 2 (Rules 12, 13) — constrain director-seat's specialization work
- (was 8 both / 2 user / 3 operator-seat / 2 director-seat = 15 at cycle-13 mid; v5.4–v5.7 added Rules #16–20, all `both` — the symmetric-discipline trend continues; total **20 rules**)

*Prior snapshot (cycle-13 close, post-v5.3 ship):* Total: **15 rules** (was 14 at cycle-13 entry, post-v5.2 ship).
**Third consecutive bundle to add a `both`-beneficiary rule** (v5.1
was 2 director-seat; v5.2 was 1 `both`; v5.3 is 1 `both`). `both` is
now the dominant category at 53.3% (8/15). R11 explicit-consent
(director in `3a0e433`; operator in proposal sign-off `dc7df5d`) was
customary per v5.1/v5.2 precedent — not required for `both`-annotated
rules but preserved for cleanliness.

**Prior snapshot (cycle-13 entry, post-v5.2 ship):**
- `both`: 7 (Rules 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14) — symmetric disciplines
- `user`: 2 (Rules 8, 11) — close gaps in user-supervision
- `operator-seat`: 3 (Rules 4, 6, 9) — operational layer where races occur
- `director-seat`: 2 (Rules 12, 13) — constrain director-seat's specialization work

Total: **14 rules** (was 13 at cycle-10 close, post-v5.1 ship).
Second consecutive bundle to add a `both`-beneficiary rule
(v5.1 was 2 director-seat; pre-v5.1 was mostly `both` with operator-seat
asymmetry). The asymmetric lean returned toward neutral; v5's
retroactive R11 analysis already disproved the "director codifies rules
favoring director-seat" bias hypothesis. R11 explicit-consent (operator
in `dea6401`) was customary not required for `both`-annotated Rule #14.

**Prior snapshot (cycle-10 close, post-v5.1 ship):**
- `both`: 6 (Rules 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10) — symmetric disciplines
- `user`: 2 (Rules 8, 11) — close gaps in user-supervision
- `operator-seat`: 3 (Rules 4, 6, 9) — operational layer where races occur
- `director-seat`: 2 (Rules 12, 13) — constrain director-seat's specialization work; empirically derived from N=2 cycle-10 failure modes; operator-seat (non-beneficiary) consented explicitly per R11 veto path

**Prior snapshot (cycle-6 close, post-v5 ship):** `both`: 6 / `user`:
2 / `operator-seat`: 3 / `director-seat`: 0 = 11 rules. (Note: the
prior text listed "`both`: 5" but the listed rule IDs (1, 2, 3, 5,
7, 10) are 6 rules — corrected at v5.1 ship as a drive-by; the
listed IDs were always correct.)

**Observed pattern (6+2+3+2 = 13):** codification has been operator-
friendly (operator-seat surfaces races they encounter in the
operational layer) and user-supervisory (mailbox-authority + bias-
check close coordination gaps the user-as-relay model couldn't
handle). v5.1 adds the first two director-seat-beneficiary rules,
empirically derived from N=2 evidence operator-seat surfaced; this
re-balances the distribution without forcing artificial balance.
The bias hypothesis the user surfaced (director codifies rules
favoring themselves) remains empirically not borne out — v5.1's
director-seat-beneficiary rules are CONSTRAINTS on director-seat's
work, not authority expansions.

**v5 self-application:** v5's components (P1, R10, R11, D, E, B, M,
S, Sh) distribute as: 7 both / 1 user / 1 operator-seat / 0 director-
seat. v5 passes its own R11 check at introduction.

**v5.1 self-application:** v5.1's two new rules (#12, #13) distribute
as: 0 both / 0 user / 0 operator-seat / 2 director-seat. v5.1 is the
FIRST asymmetric-beneficiary bundle since R11 was codified; operator-
seat (non-beneficiary) consented affirmatively in REPLY `9f032db`
per the R11 explicit-consent path. v5.1 demonstrates R11's veto
mechanism working as designed — the asymmetric annotation triggered
explicit consent rather than implicit acceptance.

**v5.2 self-application:** v5.2's one new rule (#14) distributes as:
1 both / 0 user / 0 operator-seat / 0 director-seat. v5.2 returns
the asymmetric lean toward neutral (post-v5.1's 2 director-seat).
R11 explicit consent (operator in REPLY `dea6401`) was customary per
v5.1 precedent — not required for `both`-annotated rules, but
preserved for cleanliness. v5.2 demonstrates the proposal cycle
working for a symmetric-beneficiary rule (no veto path applicable;
consent customary).

**v5.3 self-application:** v5.3's one new rule (#15) distributes as:
1 both / 0 user / 0 operator-seat / 0 director-seat. v5.3 is the
**third consecutive bundle** to add a `both`-beneficiary rule
(post-v5.2's 1 `both`); the trio progressively re-balances the
asymmetric lean introduced by v5.1's 2 director-seat additions.
R11 explicit consent (director in REPLY `3a0e433`; operator in
proposal sign-off `dc7df5d`) was customary per v5.1/v5.2 precedent —
not required for `both`-annotated rules. v5.3 also demonstrates
**N=0 bidirectional codification working as designed** per the Q4
silent-accept rationale: the operator-closes-director-flagged
direction is codified at N=0 to avoid retroactive scope-creep at
v5.4+ when N=1 emerges.

**Future bundles MUST update this snapshot** when adding new rules.
Asymmetric-beneficiary rules require explicit non-beneficiary consent
per Rule #11's veto path.

## N=1 candidates filed for future codification

Tracks rules-pipeline candidates that emerged from Lane V dispatches /
operational observations but haven't yet accumulated N=2 evidence to
warrant codification. Per the N=2-floor discipline (v5.1 R-D-1 + v5.2 Q6;
"never codify at N=0 or N=1 evidence"), candidates wait here until a
second qualitatively-distinct instance crystallizes the codifiable shape.

**Candidate numbering** preserves the original cycle-12 closure REPLY
series (`2fbe8a4`): #1-#6. Already codified: **#2 → Rule #14** at
`61cac6d` (v5.2 ship; operator-driven Lane B template); **#6 → Rule #15**
at `24c145a` (v5.3 ship; cross-seat fix-on-received-findings). The
remaining 4 candidates carry forward below. Future candidates added at
#7+.

**Promotion lifecycle** (de-facto observed; not yet codified): candidate
filed at N=1 → carry-forward annotated in transplant handoffs →
PROTOCOL-RULES-LOG.md registry entry (this section) → N=2 emergence in
later cycle → proposal-cycle drafting (operator OR director per role
partition Sh) → REPLY-cycle refinement → ship → row added to rule
registry table above → candidate row removed from this section.

### Candidate #1 — Rule #13 wording precision (audit-completeness vs audit-disposition)

- **Refines:** Rule #13 (symmetric-endpoint audit discipline; codified
  `8ab0bbb`).
- **N=1 instance:** Lane V #10 (cycle 11; mid-cycle); audit on
  `<PROJECT>_AUTO_APPROVE_<ACTION>` flag emergence raised a nuance the
  current Rule #13 wording elides: when the audit IS complete but the
  disposition decision is the gap (mirror vs. defer vs. document), the
  rule's "audit + symmetric fold OR follow-up issue" language doesn't
  distinguish completeness from disposition.
- **Current N count:** 1 (cycle-11 originating; unchanged through
  cycle-13 close).
- **Codifiable shape:** Add to Rule #13's audit-completion language an
  explicit "audit-completeness ≠ audit-disposition" distinction: the
  codifier MUST not only enumerate sibling endpoints (completeness) but
  ALSO state the disposition for each (mirror / defer / document /
  exempt). Cleanly separates "did you look?" from "what did you decide?"
- **Execution-strength transplant (2026-07-08):** Without changing the
  N=1 count or promoting this row to a new registry rule, the existing
  Rule #13 surfaces now carry the operational wording:
  audit-completeness is not audit-disposition; state the disposition for
  each sibling as mirror / defer / document / exempt.
- **N=2 emergence criteria:** A second Lane V (or director-driven audit)
  where the audit enumeration is complete but disposition is missing or
  ambiguous, AND the missed disposition cascades to a real finding (not
  just a hypothetical concern). Cycle-12 Lane V #12's audit on broad-A
  was complete + dispositioned cleanly; cycle-13 had no Rule #13
  invocations. **Watch cycle-14+ Lane V dispatches that cite Rule #13.**

### Candidate #3 — Pattern-doc cross-cycle uniformity pass mechanism

- **Refines:** F2 trigger codification (cycle-11+ workflow — when does
  the migration pattern doc trigger a uniformity pass?).
- **N=1 instance, with partial-close history:**
  - Cycle-11 originating: F2 trigger codified (initial threshold ~N=12).
  - Cycle-12 partial close: broad-B implementer's drive-by site listing
    advanced the doc but didn't lift older sites to uniform detail.
  - Cycle-13 partial close (`a3af770`): full enumeration pass at 32
    cumulative V1 production sites; per-site detail uniform.
- **Current N count:** 1.5 (per cycle-13 operator handoff). The full
  enumeration pass at `a3af770` is "third partial-close" rather than a
  discrete second N=2 instance because it's the same pattern (the docs
  uniformity is now caught up, not a new mechanism emerging).
- **Codifiable shape:** Trigger criteria for pattern-doc uniformity
  pass — e.g., "when cumulative sites cross 20 AND per-site detail
  drift exceeds X across more than Y prior pass-windows, the next
  operator-driven Lane A docs slice MUST include a uniformity pass."
  Or alternatively, fold uniformity passes into Lane B implementer
  briefs automatically (cycle-12 broad-B precedent).
- **Execution-strength transplant (2026-07-08):** Without changing the
  1.5 count or promoting this row to a new registry rule, the Rule #14
  and implementer-template surfaces now include the pattern-doc uniformity pass
  trigger: when cumulative production sites cross 20 and per-site detail drift
  is visible, the next Lane A docs slice or Lane B brief must carry the
  uniformity pass or document an exemption.
- **N=2 emergence criteria:** A FUTURE migration-pattern doc (e.g., a
  new P2-X migration doc in cycle-14+) exhibits the same partial-close
  → drift → full-enumeration-pass pattern. The emergence would
  empirically show the mechanism is doc-class-general, not specific to
  the pydantic-caller pattern. **Watch cycle-14+ for new migration
  pattern docs OR cumulative-site-count thresholds crossed without
  uniformity.**

### Candidate #4 — Rule #12 brief-pattern reference verification

- **Refines:** Rule #12 (brief-level grep-the-writes discipline;
  codified `8ab0bbb`).
- **N=1 instance:** Cycle-12 Lane V #12 OBS-1 — operator's broad-A
  dispatch-claim cited `update_location` in `project_manager.py`
  (P1-3 part 10, `1bc9263`) as Mixed-shape canonical; spec reviewer
  verified the function doesn't exist + the commit is V2 not V1 Mixed-
  shape. Implementer adapted gracefully (no commit damage). Confirmed
  by director-side Lane V #12 dispatch.
- **Current N count:** 1 (cycle-12 originating; unchanged through
  cycle-13 close — operator-driven Lane B activity was zero cycle-13).
- **Codifiable shape:** Extend Rule #12's grep-the-writes requirement
  to brief-pattern REFERENCES (canonical pattern + canonical site SHA)
  in addition to brief-pattern WRITES. The codifier MUST grep-verify
  the named function/symbol exists AT the cited SHA, AND that the
  cited SHA exhibits the named sub-pattern (V1 strict vs. V2 wrap vs.
  Base vs. Mixed-shape). Closes the brief-vs-source divergence at the
  reference layer, not just at the write-site layer.
- **Execution-strength transplant (2026-07-08):** Without changing the
  N=1 count or promoting this row to a new registry rule, the existing
  Rule #12 surfaces now carry the operational wording: brief-pattern
  references are runtime claims when they cite canonical sites; verify
  the named symbol exists at the cited SHA and verify the cited SHA
  exhibits the named sub-pattern.
- **N=2 emergence criteria:** A second brief-vs-source divergence at
  the canonical-site reference layer (operator OR director-authored
  brief cites a function/SHA combination that doesn't exhibit the
  named pattern). **Watch cycle-14+ Rule #14 dispatch-claim events
  citing canonical-site SHAs; ALSO watch director-authored implementer
  prompts citing canonical patterns.**

### Candidate #5 — Rule #13 transitive caller-side audit scope-refinement

- **Refines:** Rule #13 (symmetric-endpoint audit discipline; codified
  `8ab0bbb`). Possible scope-refinement at codification time.
- **N=1 instance:** Cycle-12 Lane V #12 I1 — IMPORTANT-advisory
  ValidationError-swallow at 2 broad-A helper-function caller sites in
  `<entrypoint>.py` <ref>. The audit on the helper-function
  migration surfaced caller-side transitive concerns. Operator's
  parallel Lane V #13 transitive audit on broad-B route-handler
  migration (14/15 clean) demonstrates the failure mode is
  STRUCTURALLY SCOPED to helper-function-encapsulated migrations, not
  route-handler-encapsulated ones.
- **Current N count:** 1 (cycle-12 originating; unchanged through
  cycle-13 close).
- **Codifiable shape:** Refine Rule #13 to distinguish "shared state
  touched by a helper function" (broader audit scope; transitive
  caller-side audit needed) from "shared state touched by a route
  handler" (narrower audit scope; the handler IS the audit boundary).
  This is a SCOPE REFINEMENT, not an extension — Rule #13's existing
  language conflates the two.
- **N=2 emergence criteria:** A second helper-function migration with
  transitive caller-side audit value (the broad-A pattern repeats on
  a different domain). ALTERNATIVELY, a route-handler migration where
  the transitive audit IS valuable (counter-example proving the scope
  distinction wrong). Either crystallizes the scope. **Watch cycle-14+
  for helper-function migrations + Rule #13 invocation patterns.**

### Candidate #7 — Carry-forward claim re-verification at handoff inheritance

- **Refines:** CLAUDE.md "Verification discipline for factual claims" §
  (Rule 1 / Rule 2 + ADR-013). Scope extension from "new claims" to
  "inherited claims older than 1 cycle."
- **N=1 instance:** Cycle-14 entry concurrency carry-forward retirement
  (`dbcde8b`). The "concurrency flake"
  `test_four_concurrent_generate_only_one_wins` was characterized in
  cycle-10 carry-forward as "environment-sensitive; not consistently
  reproducible." Handoffs at cycle-10, 11, 12, and 13 each inherited
  this framing without re-running the verifying command (run the test
  in isolation). At cycle-14 entry, isolation runs showed the test had
  been **deterministically failing 10/10** since origin commit
  `a97573e` (2026-05-24, cycle-9). The "flake" framing was false from
  the start; only full-suite execution warmth (prior tests warming
  Flask's request context) masked the timing-window bug. The cycle-13
  handoff even hypothesized "Possibly resolved by cycle-12's broader
  concurrency hardening + test-fixture leak fix" — extrapolating from
  full-suite passes to isolation-mode behavior, which is a Rule 2
  ("scoped output stays scoped") failure pattern applied to *inherited*
  rather than *newly-generated* claims.
- **Current N count:** 1 (cycle-14 entry; cycle-10 originating
  misframing).
- **Codifiable shape:** Extend the existing verification discipline so
  that carry-forward claims inherited from prior-cycle handoffs require
  re-verification at handoff-receipt time before re-assertion in the
  next handoff. Specifically: (a) the inheriting seat runs the
  verifying command before propagating the claim verbatim, OR (b)
  marks the claim "unverified-inherited" with the original handoff's
  SHA as provenance. Re-verification window: an originating handoff
  + the immediate next cycle's handoff are presumed authoritative
  (claim is "fresh"); ≥2 cycles after origin requires explicit
  re-verification at receipt time. Principle: authority and
  verification travel together (per CLAUDE.md §"When you cannot
  comply") — so *inherited* authority requires *fresh* verification or
  explicit demotion to unverified status.
- **N=2 emergence criteria:** A second carry-forward whose claim
  survives ≥2 cycle handoffs unverified, then is found materially
  false (not merely refined) at re-verification. Watch cycle-15+
  carry-forward chains; specifically watch for any current carry-forward
  (a GPU compute pod state, `<entrypoint>.py` LoC, the main orchestrator module LoC,
  a key UI component LoC) whose re-verification at handoff-receipt
  time produces a materially different answer than the inheriting
  handoff asserts. The 4 remaining N=1 candidates above (#1/#3/#4/#5)
  do NOT count as N=2 emergence for #7 — they have explicit re-audit
  cadence baked in (the "cycle-13 audit" section pattern), which
  arguably already satisfies the discipline this candidate would
  codify.
- **Beneficiary (per Rule #11):** `both` seats + `user` (cleaner
  handoff substrate; less wasted investigation time on misframed
  carry-forwards; faster carry-forward retirement when re-verification
  reveals "already-resolved" or "always-was-broken" states).

### Candidate #8 — Rule #4 RECENCY-window refinement (intra-session staleness)

- **Refines:** CLAUDE.md `## State-asserting writes: gate on \`git log --oneline -5\``
  (Rule #4). Scope extension from "pre-Write gate at session-start" to
  "pre-Write gate has a RECENCY-window — re-verify immediately before
  substantive Write if Write happens >30 min after the gate."
- **N=1 instance:** Cycle-14 mid-cycle parallel-draft collision
  (operator's `edae013` testplan + `fdd0094` escalation event +
  director's `68b92d2` decision event resolution; closed via OPTION B
  at brief v0.4 `2006217`). Operator's session started at ~T07:50Z;
  performed cold-start `ls coordination/mailbox/sent/ | tail -3` which
  truncated and missed director's `T05:00:00Z` dispatch-claim event;
  proceeded to draft ~768-line `docs/EXTENSIVE-TEST-PLAN-2026-05-27.md`
  from ~T08:15-08:25Z (substantive Write 25-35 min after cold-start
  `ls`). On finalizing the draft, operator re-`ls`'d mailbox for the
  dispatch-claim filename + **discovered director's T05 event**;
  halted publication; surfaced scope conflict to user; user adjudicated
  "escalate." A re-`ls` immediately before the Write would have caught
  T05 and prevented the parallel-draft.
- **Reinforcing N=1 instance (cycle-14 cursor-write gap):** director's
  `68b92d2` T09 decision event commit body asserted "Cursor advance:
  director `seen/director.txt` advances from `T03:00:00Z` →
  `T08:35:00Z` (consuming operator's escalation event)" but the actual
  filesystem write was missed at commit time. Closed at `ccdc420`
  cursor-fix follow-up commit on user's "check" state sweep
  discovering the discrepancy. Same shape as #1 above (state-assertion
  authored without filesystem-state verification at write-completion
  time) but at a smaller scale.
- **Current N count:** 1 (two cycle-14 instances reinforce the
  primary case but are arguably same-shape; counting as N=1 for
  N=2-floor discipline conservatism per v5.1 R-D-1).
- **Codifiable shape:** Extend Rule #4 with a RECENCY-window clause.
  Specifically: (a) the pre-Write gate (`git log -5` + mailbox `ls`)
  authoritative for ≤30 minutes; (b) substantive Writes happening
  >30 min after the gate MUST re-run the verifying command
  immediately before commit (per Rule #7 pre-commit re-verify), AND
  re-run the gate command immediately before substantive Write-start
  to capture mid-session drift; (c) "substantive Write" = any
  Write/Edit that asserts state about the repo (handoff content,
  cross-seat events, doc-claim with file paths or counts, brief
  content referring to other commits). Mechanical cursor-advance or
  doc-typo fixes are NOT substantive Writes (no re-gate needed).
  Principle: pre-Write gate is a snapshot, not a license — staleness
  accumulates as the session progresses.
- **Distinction from Candidate #7:** failure-mode shape, evidence
  base, remediation, and trigger window all differ — see operator's
  REPLY `a9b1c32` §"Ask #5" for the 5-row distinction table. Folding
  #8 into #7 would lose the distinct intra-session-vs-inter-session
  remediation discipline.
- **N=2 emergence criteria:** A second intra-session mailbox-state-
  staleness incident causing operational error (e.g., another
  parallel-draft collision in a different cycle; OR a director-side
  decision-event ship with cursor-write gap; OR a director-or-
  operator-side ship that asserts state about a recently-modified
  file the seat hasn't re-read). Watch cycle-15+ for similar shapes,
  particularly during high-velocity parallel work where both seats
  ship multiple commits per hour.
- **Beneficiary (per Rule #11):** `both` seats + `user` (prevents
  wasted parallel work; reduces escalation cycles; cleaner audit
  trail for state-asserting writes).

### Cycle-13 audit (cycle-14 entry watchpoint refresh)

Cycle 13 was the **first markdown-only protocol-substrate cycle** (no
new feat/refactor commits triggering Lane V dispatches; only `chore`,
`docs`, `test`, and the `336403d` `fix(web)` M-3 close which received
operator-judgment Lane V skip). **NO movement on any of the 4
candidates in cycle-13:**

- **#1:** 0 new Rule #13 invocations cycle-13. N=1 unchanged.
- **#3:** Cycle-13 `a3af770` added a partial-close but candidate stays
  at N=1.5; no new pattern-doc mechanism emergence.
- **#4:** 0 new operator-driven Lane B dispatch-claim events
  cycle-13 (cycle-13 was markdown-only). N=1 unchanged.
- **#5:** 0 new Rule #13 invocations cycle-13. N=1 unchanged.

**Next operator-seat OR director-seat session should re-audit at
cycle-14 close** when new Lane V dispatches OR new brief activity
crosses one of the N=2 emergence criteria above. Per Rule #14 +
Rule #15 codification cadence (v5.2 + v5.3 shipped same cycle once
N=2 accumulated), the v5.4 ship can happen quickly once the first
candidate crosses.

### Cycle-14 mid-cycle audit (substrate work per user direction "n=2")

Cycle 14 is in-progress at audit-write time. Mid-cycle re-audit
during director's substrate work covers: cycle-13's open candidates
(#1, #3, #4, #5) + cycle-14's new candidate (#7).

- **#1 (Rule #13 wording precision):** 0 new Rule #13 invocations
  cycle-14 mid-cycle (no Lane V dispatches; the cycle-14
  `dbcde8b` retirement was direct code work, not an audit-with-
  disposition). N=1 unchanged.
- **#3 (Pattern-doc uniformity pass mechanism):** 0 new migration
  pattern docs cycle-14. Only the pydantic-caller pattern doc
  exists; no P2-X migrations have started. N=1.5 unchanged.
- **#4 (Rule #12 brief-pattern reference verification):** 0 new
  operator-driven Lane B dispatch-claim events cycle-14 (mid-cycle;
  no operator Lane B activity). Director-side commit-body SHA
  citations during cycle-14 (the main orchestrator module LoC drift, cycle-13
  handoff misframing) reference commits accurately; no
  brief-pattern reference divergence. N=1 unchanged.
- **#5 (Rule #13 transitive caller-side audit scope-refinement):**
  0 new helper-function migrations cycle-14. N=1 unchanged.
  **Significant empirical inverse evidence already in hand from
  Lane V #13** (cycle 12, `7472d31..a0493dc`): operator's
  high-leverage transitive-audit on broad-B's 15 route-handler-
  direct sites returned 14/15 clean (the 1/15 was a brief-OOS
  thread-swallow site, not a transitive-audit miss). This inverse
  evidence is N=1 strength but empirically distinct from N=2
  same-shape evidence. **v5.4 codification could legitimately
  scope-refine to "helper-function-encapsulated migrations only"
  without a second helper-function-positive instance, if the
  next proposal-cycle director judges the inverse evidence
  load-bearing.** Director-discretion decision for v5.4+ proposal
  cycle.
- **#7 (Carry-forward claim re-verification at handoff
  inheritance) — NEW cycle-14:** Filed at `a76d881` during cycle-14
  substrate work. N=1 instance: concurrency flake operational
  carry-forward retired at `dbcde8b` (cycle-14 entry) after 4-cycle
  inheritance (cycle-10 → 14). **Scope clarification surfaced
  during cycle-14 POST-ROADMAP refresh (`69202da`):** state-of-
  affairs LoC claims (the main orchestrator module <ref> inherited 4 cycles
  in POST-ROADMAP doc cycle-9 → cycle-13 unchanged; the HTTP entrypoint module
  <ref> inherited 1 cycle in cycle-13 handoff; a key UI component
  <ref> inherited 1 cycle in cycle-13 handoff) drifted from actual
  values (see <ref>). **These drifts are Rule #1 violations
  (claims without verification output), NOT Candidate #7 instances
  per scope clarification.** Candidate #7's scope is *operational
  carry-forwards* (open tasks / open decisions / open hypotheses
  about WORK), not state-snapshot claims about file contents. The
  fix-pattern differs: Rule #1 enforcement = "run the verifying
  command before stating the count"; Candidate #7 discipline =
  "re-investigate the underlying task before propagating its
  framing forward through handoffs." Different remediation =
  different scope. N=2 watch criterion for #7 stays "operational
  carry-forward whose claim survives ≥2 cycle handoffs unverified,
  found materially false at re-verification."

**Net N=2 status across all 5 candidates: NONE emerged cycle-14
mid-cycle. No v5.4 ship-candidate ready.** Substrate is stable;
codification discipline (N=2 floor) holds. **Director-discretion
opening:** Candidate #5's inverse-evidence pattern could justify
v5.4 ship at N=1+inverse if a future proposal-cycle director
judges the empirical strength load-bearing. Otherwise: continue
N=2 watch through cycle-15+.

**Next re-audit at cycle-14 close** (next director's handoff doc or
next operator's re-audit; whichever ships first). Re-audit cadence
mid-cycle is OPTIONAL — established cadence is at cycle-close, but
cycle-14 mid-cycle audit was triggered by user direction "n=2"
during ongoing substrate work and produced this subsection.

### Candidate #9 — Rule #19 mitigation (d): current_task describes ACTIVITY, not cached volatile shared-state

- **Refines:** Rule #19 (live-presence-over-inferred-idle; codified `cec6d72`).
  Rule #19's existing `current_task`-rot guard (CLAUDE.md ~:1873-1879) targets the
  OPPOSITE failure — `current_task` UNCHANGED / semantically stale. This candidate
  covers the inverse: a `current_task` that DID change (fresh file, fresh `updated`)
  yet embeds a STALE volatile value.
- **N=1 instance:** 2026-06-09 (post-portrait-arc; both seats live in parallel via
  user "continue as operator" / "continue as director"). `director.md current_task`
  — fresh (status:active, `updated` within seconds) — embedded TWO stale volatile
  claims: "director 0 unread (cursor 00:53:45Z)" (actually ≥1 unread; verified live
  via `status.py mailbox-unread director`) AND "operator 3 unread (offline)"
  (operator was LIVE at 0 unread — the exact inferred-idle error Rule #19 set out to
  kill, re-introduced by caching the PEER's liveness into one's OWN `current_task`).
  Surfaced by operator; ping `2026-06-09T04-42-44Z-operator-to-director-coordination.md`.
- **Current N count:** 1 (originating 2026-06-09).
- **REALIZED-HARM emergence criterion (the N=2 trigger):** a SECOND instance where a
  seat takes a **wrong action** off a peer-status or count value frozen into presence
  prose — NOT merely a stale value that caused no action (this session's harm was
  latent only: the operator caught it before any mis-action). Latent stale values
  alone do NOT advance N.
- **Codifiable shape (when N=2):** a single principle-clause as Rule #19 mitigation
  (d) — NOT an enumerated-list ban (which rots; the next volatile quantity not on the
  list slips through): *"current_task describes THIS seat's own ACTIVITY; never assert
  the peer's liveness or freeze any volatile shared-state value (unread N, ahead/behind)
  — recompute those live at read-time."* Actionable only once live-recompute is cheap;
  that prerequisite is now satisfied (`status.py mailbox-unread <seat>`, shipped `3fa29c9`).
- **Beneficiary (Rule #11):** both (symmetric — either seat can freeze a stale
  count / peer-status into its own `current_task`).
- **Provenance:** protocol-upgrade analysis workflow `wf_9c032336-468` (operator,
  2026-06-09); the adversarial-critique pass downgraded this from "codify-now" to
  N=1-file per the N=2 floor, explicitly resisting bundling it with the (distinct,
  computation-not-caching) instrument candidate to manufacture N. (The dated
  "across all 5 candidates" net-status note above is a cycle-14 snapshot, left as
  historical; this is candidate #9.)

## Invocation log

**Note on plateau interpretation (per Protocol Bundle v3 §Minor):** Rule
emergence rate is measured per-regime. The current regime is parallel-session
operator+director coordination at modest throughput (~20-30 commits per
session, ~3-4 sessions per cycle). Different regimes (higher throughput,
longer runs, more concurrent roles, external CI pressure) may surface
failure modes the existing rules don't catch. **Plateau in this regime ≠
convergence in all regimes.** Treat the current 8-rule set as stable for
current conditions, not as a complete protocol.

## Infrastructure audits

| Audit | Scope | Findings doc | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hook script (v2.1 baseline) | `.claude/hooks/update-state.sh` vs v2 §A as amended by v2.1 | `docs/AUDIT-hook-script-v2-2026-05-24.md` (not transplanted to this repo) | `3340d1f` |

### v5.8 — per-seat index auto-refresh (D-a hardening), 2026-06-08

**Mechanism:** `update-state.sh::_sync_seat_index()` fast-forwards a seat's
stale `GIT_INDEX_FILE` to HEAD on peer-commit staleness, called BEFORE the
shared skip-perf gate (the committing seat advances the shared `.last-state-head`
marker first, so gating behind it would skip the sync exactly when needed).
`git read-tree` fires in exactly one case (C1: index byte-equals the
last-synced commit's tree, no staged work) — staged-WIP loss excluded by
construction; the mixed case (C2: staged work + peer commit) stays manual
(`git read-tree -m`).

**Empirical basis:** D-a stale-index phantom-deletion storms ~4×/session on
2026-06-07 (peak 1015 status lines; one 600-file skip-worktree-bit variant;
director hit a 254-file storm independently). The manual `git read-tree HEAD`
workaround (memory `feedback_da_stale_index_refresh`) was failure-prone.

**Beneficiary (per Rule #11): `both`** — symmetric; both seats' indexes are
maintained, both lose the manual-resync chore. Operator drafted (PROPOSAL +
dispatch-claim `03fc21d`, Rule #14 operator-driven Lane B); director reviewed
the implementation independently (Rule #9 parallel pass — safety property
verified, 7 awk-extraction tests guarding the real function, suite 1723 green)
→ CONSENT; director ships the protocol text per Sh partition.

**SHAs:** impl `454e770` (+ Lane V minor-fold `a614f68`: atomic marker write
via tmp+`mv -f`, C2/D residual comment); operator Lane V ✅ READY / 0-blocking
at `31d5c96` (the one IMPORTANT was a false positive, disproven by branch
coverage). Text-ship _v5.8 (this commit; filled next session-close per
chicken-and-egg precedent)_. Working criteria C1-C4 in PROPOSAL §4 (dogfood at
v5.9/retro: zero storm reports in next 2 sessions; any staged-WIP-loss incident
= immediate revert).

**Process note (self-modification gate):** edits to
`.claude/hooks/update-state.sh` are an *agent-loaded hook* — the harness
auto-mode classifier treats them as self-modification and **gates them on USER
authorization per session** (peer-seat concurrence does NOT substitute).
Observed when the operator's Lane A fold to the hook was blocked until
user-authorized via AskUserQuestion. Future seats touching this hook should
expect the gate.

### Session 2026-05-24-cycle-3 (this conversation)

### R-SKILL — project-skill load triggers (2026-06-12, operator ship)

**Mechanism:** CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md rule block — invoke `<domain-skill>`
before authoring/reviewing/debugging domain-graph code or configuration, and
`<domain-skill>` before pipeline-level design work; when a
skill prior shapes a verdict, name it in the work product.

<!-- TODO(<PROJECT>): add this project's domain-skill triggers -->
**Empirical basis:** <ref> GO/NO-GO verdicts on a domain-graph subsystem were
shaped by `<domain-skill>` priors (documented single-instance constraint →
identity blending is the expected dual-chain failure mode → a measurable
pass/fail criterion; a documented escape-hatch parameter became the recorded
Pass-B direction). The priors only entered the review because the operator
happened to have the skill loaded — the user asked whether both seats use it
(<ref>); operator offered codification; user approved
("proceed with recommendation"). Shipped with the same commit: the skill's
integration section re-synced against live code (domain-graph node count <ref>;
compute host updated to current provider; production parameter table
re-snapshotted from `<PROJECT>` workflow templates; max-tier graph documented).

**Beneficiary (per Rule #11): `both` seats + user** — verdicts grounded in
documented subsystem semantics rather than recall, on both authoring and reviewing
sides.
Enforcement: SOFT

### Rules #21 + #22 + R-MEASURE + dispatch git-hygiene + SessionStart sweep (2026-06-12, operator ship, user-directed)

One user-directed hardening batch ("plan to apply these", 2026-06-12) of four
items surfaced by the 2026-06-11/12 sessions; plan
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-12-two-seat-process-hardening.md`:

- **Rule #21 verdict-ahead-of-report** — basis: `6f3b809` verdict-first
  unblocked a billed GPU compute pod session; report `3a13156` followed; nothing
  reversed. Beneficiary (Rule #11): both + user (billed-clock waste removed).
  Enforcement: SOFT
- **Rule #22 flag-before-burn** — basis: reviewed sweep ran clean;
  unreviewed script carried the F1 fee-respend defect (`3a589da`
  guard). Beneficiary: both + user (fee protection).
  Enforcement: SOFT
- **R-MEASURE** — basis: <ref> verdict numbers were REPL-only
  (operator Lane V <ref>, disposed `b91c6c9`; a domain metric scorer queued
  wave-2 is the instance). Beneficiary: both + user
  (reproducible records).
  Enforcement: SOFT
- **Dispatch git-hygiene (templates + CLAUDE/AGENTS clause)** — basis:
  index-operator corruption 2026-06-12 ("unable to read <blob>") during a
  31-agent workflow; per-invocation `env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE` (subagent shell
  state does not persist). Beneficiary: both (either seat's index).
  Enforcement: SOFT
- **SessionStart sweep registration** — closes the v5.9 post-last-hook-fire
  window (strike #2, 866 paths). Local registration documented in
  OPERATIONS.md. Beneficiary: both.
  Enforcement: SOFT

All five invocable from codification; invocation counts start at the next
session table.

## 2026-06-13 addendum — R-VERIFY-TIER (capacity audit `wf_6be2ee18-f4b`)

- **R-VERIFY-TIER** — caps verification DEPTH where R-EVIDENCE / Rule #9 only ever
  raised it. (A) doc-only deferred-defect notes converge at TWO independent seats
  (a Rule #23 co-sign counts as one); a 3rd pass requires a stated new question.
  (B) agent-confirmed unfixed defects ship a `pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True)` pin
  or a `test-infeasible` label in the same session. Empirical basis: a domain-architecture doc note drew ~25–31 Sonnet agent-runs
  across 4 adversarial passes (`wf_73f95c8c` / `wf_e09bded6` / `wf_5d39bbe3` /
  `wf_ed13f2b4`) for one doc paragraph + 0 fix lines. Beneficiary: both (frees agent-cycles for the deliverable).
  Consent: principal-directed (capacity audit, 2026-06-13). Does NOT relax
  production-code verification — Lane V / Rule #9 per-commit checks unchanged.
  Note: this is the corpus's first depth-CAP rule; it reduces protocol work.
  Enforcement: HARD (partial) — `scripts/check_no_ceremony.py` R1 (`rule_xfail_strictness`, lines 61-96) hard-gates the `strict=True`+`reason=` requirement on xfail pins (R-VERIFY-TIER part B); the depth-cap discipline (no 3rd verification pass without a new question) remains SOFT.

## 2026-06-14 addendum — Rule #23 async-split (Lever #7, capacity audit `wf_6be2ee18-f4b`)

- **Rule #23 co-sign classifier** — splits the single "both directors' sign-off"
  obligation into two tiers so an awareness heads-up no longer serializes behind a
  full session. Classifier: *would the co-signer's verification change which
  files/sites the implementation touches?* **Tier A** (yes, implementation-scope-
  determining): co-signer lands a mailbox `verification-report` BEFORE dispatch —
  async-fulfillable via workflow+mailbox, no session restart. **Tier B** (no,
  awareness-only): `-to-all-` heads-up, 48h proceed-if-no-objection. Empirical
  basis: a Tier A co-sign caught a domain-specific regression the brief's caller-grep missed; a scope-awareness ACK was Tier B
  and round-tripped in <10min. Body in four-seat-extension.md §6. Beneficiary: both
  (unblocks cross-pair throughput without weakening scope-determining review).
  Enforcement: SOFT

## 2026-06-16 addendum — Codex live-protocol state rules (user-directed)

User-directed codification after live coordinator operation on Wave 2. The
rules are Codex-specific mechanics, mirrored in `docs/protocol/codex/continuation.md`
and `.agents/skills/`. Registry Rules #24-#26 are the durable rule entries for
`R-CODEX-MAIL`, `R-CODEX-SEATINDEX`, and `R-CODEX-LEARN`; the remaining
`R-CODEX-*` bullets are related operational mechanics codified in the same
hardening pass.

- **R-CODEX-MAIL** — always check mail before protocol decisions, handoff,
  routing, inventory/gate claims, or state-asserting protocol writes. Live seats
  read unread mail by default after surfacing the unread count; decisions come
  from mailbox bodies, not counts alone; `consume-events` is a separate
  intentional cursor mutation. Coordinator is unpinned and reads all-scope mail
  without cursor mutation. Refresh before finalizing if seats are active. Basis:
  coordinator handoff/routing turns where unread counts changed during the
  session; the user explicitly corrected the process to "always read mail" and
  later to "alway check mail codify it".
  Enforcement: SOFT
- **R-CODEX-CONSOLIDATE** — cross-seat coordinator routing should be one
  consolidated `coordinator-to-all` task-board event naming every seat's task,
  unread/cursor context, lock/push/spend status, allowed write set, and expected
  output. Basis: `e6205050 coord(route): notify wave2 seat tasks`, which avoided
  four divergent seat-specific task messages.
  Enforcement: SOFT
- **R-CODEX-RECEIPT** — after a consolidated task-board event, inspect receipt
  with `python scripts/status.py snapshot <seat>` for each explicitly assigned
  live pair seat; the snapshot reports
  mailbox/cursor state, not completion of assigned work. Basis: the post-route
  refresh showed a split board (`director=0`, `operator=3`, `director2=1`,
  `operator2=1`) after `e6205050`.
  Enforcement: SOFT
- **R-CODEX-INDEX** — ordinary git/pytest commands run with
  `env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE`; coordinator-only docs/mailbox/log commits in a dirty
  shared index use a scoped temporary index and staged-scope inspection. Basis:
  the PreToolUse hook blocked a command containing `git read-tree HEAD` and
  `git status --short` while `GIT_INDEX_FILE` was set.
  Enforcement: SOFT
- **R-CODEX-SEATINDEX** — for live-seat cursor-only consumes after `HEAD` moved,
  refresh the seat-local index to `HEAD` and verify the staged scope is only
  `M coordination/mailbox/seen/<seat>.txt`. If there is intentional staged work,
  reconcile deliberately instead of blindly resetting. Basis: stale seat-local
  indexes produced bogus deletion scope after newer mailbox files landed.
  Enforcement: SOFT
- **R-CODEX-NOLOCK** — when push, pod spend, paid API spend, or lock-claim side
  effects are not user-authorized, route eligible no-lock work first or stop for
  authorization. Basis: Wave 2 task-board routing selected the no-lock checkpoint
  cluster while HTTP and `auto_approve.py` rows remained push/lock-gated.
  Enforcement: SOFT
- **R-CODEX-HANDOFF** — a bare `handoff` request means a narrow state-transfer
  artifact from live evidence, not invented implementation, verification,
  inventory churn, or mailbox noise. Basis: repeated Content repo handoff turns
  where stale snapshots and broad staging were the primary risk.
  Enforcement: SOFT
- **R-CODEX-LEARN** — when a live protocol observation would improve capacity,
  efficacy, or efficiency, preserve it as durable memory if the user has
  authorized memory updates; if broadly reusable, codify it in the relevant
  protocol docs/skills with evidence. Basis: user-principal explicitly asked to
  keep such observations in memory and then to turn those rules into codified
  state.
  Enforcement: SOFT

- **R-HOT-TREE** — Never trust a refs snapshot older than your last step. The HEAD can move multiple times during a single burst of work. Always execute `git log --oneline -3` and check the latest mailbox events right before writing your commit or making a gate decision. Basis: Session-12 (ADR-027) where the shared tree HEAD moved 12x under the coordinator, leading to potential stale contexts.
  Enforcement: SOFT
- **R-WIP-POLLUTION** — Do NOT run auto-fix scripts (like `check_doc_claims.py --fix`) mid-burst over a peer's uncommitted WIP. The lane owner is strictly responsible for fixing anchors upon touch. Always use `env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE` and strict pathspecs when staging commits. Basis: Session-12 (ADR-027) where transient peer WIP almost triggered an accidental overwrite of the architecture doc.
  Enforcement: SOFT
- **R-GATE-EVIDENCE** — Do not cite `wave_gate_check` output alone as `R-EVIDENCE`. The gate script reads the inventory string, it does not execute tests. To claim correctness, the coordinator MUST cite the underlying executed regression pins or the operator's formal GO event. Basis: Session-12 (ADR-027) critique where the wave gate was incorrectly treated as a correctness proof.
  Enforcement: HARD — `scripts/check_go_schema.py` accepts either an exact committed historical path/raw-byte digest from the legacy manifest or a strict `lane-v-report/v3`. New reports require the ordered provider-neutral attestation, command/output evidence, full reviewed SHAs, one committed descriptor, one lawful trigger, and a non-author operator identity. `coordination/bin/send-event` publishes atomically only through the task-bound `TaskPublicationStore`; direct mailbox writes, hooks, model identity, and provider identity grant no authority. GO whose only evidence is `wave_gate_check` without pytest/runxfail re-execution still fails.
- **R-VERIFY-THEN-PUSH** — Never push pre-GO. Pushing unverified fixes risks NITS arriving directly on the remote origin, fracturing the verification history. Always wait for the operator's verification GO before executing the push. Basis: Session-12 where a `web_research` fix pushed pre-GO (per user override) came back as NITS on origin, realizing the exact risk verify-then-push prevents.
  Enforcement: SOFT

## Retirement criteria

A rule unused for 5 consecutive sessions → flagged for review.
If still unused after 3 more sessions → retired (moved to "## Retired rules"
section below with retirement-SHA + reason).

## Retired rules

_None yet. As rules retire, append here with retirement-SHA + reason._

## Phase 2 (deferred)

Auto-detection of rule invocations via grep on commit-body keywords. Wait
until manual logging accumulates ~3-5 sessions of data so we know which
phrases are reliable signals. Goal: hook into the same PostToolUse pipeline
that maintains STATE.md, increment per-rule counters on commit.
