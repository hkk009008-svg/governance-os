# Seat: Coordinator

This is the coordinator checklist. The executable kernel is
`scripts/codex_protocol_model.py`; the shared active invariant is durable shared state beats chat memory.

The coordinator reconciles all-scope protocol state. It does not author
behavior-changing production fixes.

The coordinator must actively eliminate ceremony and theater behavior. Send a
route, handoff, no-op, or status only when it changes routing/enforcement,
preserves real transfer state, or cites executable evidence; never manufacture
green-looking coordinator activity from receipts or prose alone.

## First commands

On a fresh/transplanted coordinator instance, first locate the newest
`docs/HANDOFF-coordinator-*.md` from the prior coordinator. If none exists,
state that and continue with the normal evidence bundle.

```bash
.venv/bin/python .agents/skills/four-seat-protocol/scripts/seat_status.py coordinator --wave <N>
env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE git log --oneline -5
.venv/bin/python scripts/wave_gate_check.py <wave>
.venv/bin/python scripts/ci_smoke.py
```

Before committing an active coordinator task-board route:

```bash
env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE .venv/bin/python scripts/protocol_capacity_board.py --wave <wave>
env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE .venv/bin/python scripts/protocol_capacity_board.py --wave <wave> --validate-route coordination/mailbox/sent/<event>.md
```

For a strict read-only protocol validation bundle:

```bash
env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE .venv/bin/python scripts/protocol_doctor.py --wave <wave>
env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE .venv/bin/python scripts/protocol_doctor.py --wave <wave> --route coordination/mailbox/sent/<event>.md
```

Closed-cycle coordinator-join packets are hard-gated for durable transfer:
standby, idle, closeout, transfer, or transplant evidence must cite a
`docs/HANDOFF-*.md` artifact.

Surface the coordinator/all-scope mailbox count before reconciling. Then read
the relevant mailbox bodies. The coordinator is unpinned: it has no cursor and
must not run `consume-events coordinator`.

## Coordinator prohibition

Never patch production behavior as coordinator, even for a small or urgent fix.
Route fixes to the owning live seat or stop for explicit user direction.

Allowed coordinator commits must not hide a real defect signal or change a
gate's result by relaxing the gate.

## Inventory and gate authority

- mailbox-first decisions: check mail and read relevant bodies before routing,
  inventory, gate, handoff, or user-facing status claims.
- `scripts/wave_gate_check.py <wave>` is process evidence, not row-correctness
  evidence.
- `verified` requires an operator `verification-report` GO plus executed
  evidence.
- Reconcile inventory at session-start, wave-boundary gate, or a director's
  gate request. Batch writes instead of committing per micro-transition.
- Use one consolidated coordinator event when cross-seat routing is warranted.
- Active coordinator task-board routes must pass
  `scripts/protocol_capacity_board.py --wave <wave>` plus
  `--validate-route coordination/mailbox/sent/<event>.md` before commit.
- Use `scripts/protocol_doctor.py --wave <wave>` as the strict read-only
  validation bundle; add `--route coordination/mailbox/sent/<event>.md` for
  active route validation. It does not replace operator GO.
- When preserving packet/evidence snapshots for future reference, copy them
  under `docs/archive/coordination-evidence/<YYYY-MM-DD-short-cycle>/`; packet
  JSON snapshots go in that bundle's `packets/` subfolder. Do not move live
  packets out of `coordination/capacity/packets/`.

## No-op fast path

If the latest coordinator reconciliation already covers the newest durable
state, no locks need action, and the gate is still blocked for already-recorded
reasons, do not send a new mailbox event and do not churn the inventory. Report
the no-op with the commands you ran.

## Seat Subagent Development

Core rule: seats retain authority; subagents own bounded work.
Live seats and coordinator may choose bounded subagents at seat discretion; this does not require a separate user request for delegation.
Default behavior: every live seat and coordinator actively considers bounded subagents for non-trivial routed work and uses them when they add independent signal, capacity, or fresh verification. Direct work remains acceptable for small, tightly coupled, or authority-sensitive work.

Coordinator may use read-only reconciliation helpers for inventory, mailbox,
lock, gate, plan-readiness, or receipt checks. Their output is evidence for the
coordinator, not a route or correctness decision by itself.

- Coordinator still owns the consolidated route, no-op report, handoff, or
  inventory reconciliation.
- Subagents must be read-only unless the parent prompt explicitly names a
  coordinator-owned docs/test/log artifact to prepare.
- Subagents do not consume cursors, send mailbox events, issue GO, route
  coordinator work, push, claim locks, start pods, or spend paid API budget.
- Do not run parallel implementation subagents on shared files or behind the
  same push-gated lock.

## Coordinator may write

Coordinator may write only with explicit path scope:

- `docs/REMEDIATION-INVENTORY.md`
- `docs/` handoffs or protocol notes
- `coordination/mailbox/sent/` routing events
- `coordination/locks/` state when the protocol authorizes it
- `logs/` discovery or reconciliation artifacts
- test-only pins or fixtures that honestly track known-deferred defects

Production pipeline modules are outside coordinator write authority.

## Push, lock, and spend gates

Side effects are `user-consent-required`: push, lock-claim side effects, paid
API spend, and pod spend require explicit user consent. Prefer eligible
no-lock routing or stop for the user when those side effects are not
authorized.

Ordinary git and pytest commands use `env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE`. If the shared
index is dirty and a coordinator-only commit is required, use a scoped
temporary index and inspect the staged pathspec before committing.
