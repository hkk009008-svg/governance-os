# About this document

This file is the **agent-agnostic root** for AI coding tools working in this
repo (Cursor, Aider, Copilot, Continue, Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, etc.).
Everything below is the agent-agnostic project guide — canonical project
facts plus the discipline that ships clean code here.

**Claude Code specifically:** `CLAUDE.md` is the Claude-specific companion.
It mirrors this file's discipline section using Claude's actual tool
syntax (`Agent` subagent dispatch, `subagent_type` values, prompt
templates, `Skill` invocation, `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`,
`AskUserQuestion`, the `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` skill,
etc.). Claude Code agents read **both** files; this one defines the
principles, `CLAUDE.md` defines the mechanics.

**Codex specifically:** Codex reads this file directly, then uses the
executable harness model in `scripts/codex_protocol_model.py`,
`docs/protocol/codex/continuation.md`, plus the repo skill
`.agents/skills/four-seat-protocol/SKILL.md` for Codex-native mechanics
(`update_plan`, Codex subagents, `.codex/agents`, `.codex/hooks.json`, and
`apply_patch`). Codex agents are readiness bridges by default; they become
director/operator/coordinator seats only on explicit user instruction. The
kernel owns the active invariant set: durable shared state beats chat memory,
mailbox-first decisions, explicit mode, env-u git policy, user-gated side
effects, coordinator no-production-fix authority, and operator GO requirements.
Use the continuation adapter for first commands, optional tools, and the narrow
handoff rule at real transfer boundaries.

Codex start-session inhabitance: fresh sessions inhabit the Codex harness as a
readiness bridge unless the user or parent prompt names a live seat or
coordinator. The six built-in `.codex/agents/*.toml` role agents remain the
core modules; optional `.codex/agents/agentNN.toml` files are self-codified
guardrail extensions and do not replace seat authority, mailbox cursor rules,
or user-gated push.
User-principal authorization: live director/operator seats and the coordinator
may choose bounded subagents at seat discretion; this does not require a separate user request for delegation.
Default behavior: every live seat and coordinator actively considers bounded
subagents for non-trivial routed work and uses them when they add independent
signal, capacity, or fresh verification. Direct work remains acceptable for
small, tightly coupled, or authority-sensitive work.
Subagents remain advisory helpers and do not inherit mailbox, cursor, GO,
coordinator-route, lock, push, pod-spend, or paid-API-spend authority.
When a fresh or transplanted Codex instance is assigned a live seat or
coordinator, its first seat-specific action is to locate the newest same-kind
handoff for that concrete role (`docs/HANDOFF-<seat>-*.md` or
`docs/HANDOFF-coordinator-*.md`) before ordinary orientation. Concrete seat
identity wins over behavior source: `director` resumes from `HANDOFF-director-*`
and `operator2` resumes from `HANDOFF-operator2-*`.

Codex live protocol rules are codified in
`scripts/codex_protocol_model.py`, adapted in
`docs/protocol/codex/continuation.md`, and mirrored as checklists in
`.agents/skills/`.
In short: always check mail before protocol decisions or state-asserting
writes; read the relevant mailbox bodies instead of deciding from counts alone,
do not consume coordinator mail, route cross-seat work with one consolidated
coordinator event, verify broadcast receipt seat-by-seat, use
`env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE` for ordinary git/pytest, use a scoped temporary index
for coordinator-only commits when the shared index is dirty, and prefer
eligible no-lock work when push/lock side effects are not user-authorized.
Active coordinator task-board routes must first pass the hard-gated capacity
board:
`env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE .venv/bin/python scripts/protocol_capacity_board.py --wave <wave>`
and
`env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE .venv/bin/python scripts/protocol_capacity_board.py --wave <wave> --validate-route coordination/mailbox/sent/<event>.md`.

Ledger-routed Codex seats start from `/Users/hyungkoookkim/Pipeline`, not
`/Users/hyungkoookkim/Content`. Before any seat enters
`/Users/hyungkoookkim/evidence-ledger`, run
`env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE .venv/bin/python scripts/ledger_start_guard.py --seat <seat> --wave 2`
from Pipeline and read the active coordinator route it reports.

**Antigravity specifically:** Antigravity ("agy", the Gemini-based agentic IDE)
reads this file as its agent-agnostic source of truth and translates the
principles into its own mechanisms. In the **three-way cross-provider protocol**
(`docs/protocol/threeway/`) it holds **no seat** by design — it is off every
build / verify / integrate / bus-write path — and participates only as a
human-relayed strategic-reasoner (the dual-chief app axis) or a read-only
observer. For any work an Antigravity session does, it follows the same operating
discipline as every other tool here. Its adoption manual + the per-provider
capability mapping are in
`docs/protocol/threeway/ANTIGRAVITY-ADOPTION.md`; note that the Antigravity-specific
protocol harness is fully codified in the `.agents/skills/antigravity-harness/SKILL.md` skill,
which maps the unified doctrine strictly to Antigravity's tool primitives.

**Running all three providers as one system:** Claude + Codex + Antigravity share
one operating doctrine. The unified statement of the shared rules, the Layer-1
(cross-provider protocol) vs Layer-2 (portable doctrine) split, and the
per-provider capability map live in
[`docs/protocol/threeway/UNIFIED-OPERATING-DOCTRINE.md`](docs/protocol/threeway/UNIFIED-OPERATING-DOCTRINE.md).
This file remains the principle root; that doc folds in the signed-bus protocol
and Antigravity.

**Non-Claude agents:** read this file as your source of truth. Translate
the principles ("fresh context per task", "two-stage review",
"verify-before-acting") into your tool's analogous mechanisms (new chat
session, manual diff review, `git grep` for verification, etc.).

# Session-start protocol (read me first)

**Truth lives in `ARCHITECTURE.md` at the repo root.** This file (AGENTS.md)
is the *process layer* — agent-agnostic principles (multi-task
orchestration, session discipline) shared by all AI coding tools.
`ARCHITECTURE.md` is the *truth layer* — verified facts about the project,
with file:line references and a §15 smoke test. When they disagree about
facts, `ARCHITECTURE.md` wins.

Both files drift from the actual code between sessions. Before doing any
non-trivial work, verify against current source. If a claim is stale,
**fix the relevant file in the same change** that exposes the staleness —
don't let a wrong claim survive your session.

Trust the code; update the prose when it diverges.

## Load policy (how to use this file)

This file is an **operative router**: it holds only what must be active *before
you know the task*. Everything task-specific lives in linked docs, pulled on demand.

- Do NOT read linked protocol docs at session start.
- Read a linked doc only when its trigger fires.
- When dispatching a subagent, include only the relevant rule IDs + template
  slice — never inherited doctrine. Every dispatch includes the templates'
  **Git hygiene** block (subagents prefix all git with `env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE`
  — seat-index corruption vector, 2026-06-12).
- `docs/PROGRAM-MANUAL.md` is pull-on-demand only — read
  `docs/protocol/program-manual-guide.md` before using/maintaining it; never load
  the full manual at session start.

## R-START — session-start checklist
Scope: both
Trigger: start of every session, before non-trivial work.
Action: (1) Run the §15 smoke block in `ARCHITECTURE.md` (`scripts/ci_smoke.py`); if
it fails, the doc is stale OR the working tree is broken — fix one before proceeding.
(2) Skim `ARCHITECTURE.md` §2 topology; spot-check <project smoke invariants — implemented in scripts/ci_smoke.py _project_smoke()>. (3) `git log --oneline -20`; if a commit touched a module
documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md` since its `*Last verified:*` footer, re-read that
section against the code. (4) If you find a stale claim, fix `ARCHITECTURE.md` first,
in the same commit (or a `docs:` prep commit right before) the task lands.
Evidence: smoke output captured; the fixing commit when a claim was stale.

# The user-principal's intent for this program (read PROGRAM-MANUAL.md)

**The user-principal has designated [docs/PROGRAM-MANUAL.md](docs/PROGRAM-MANUAL.md)
as the canonical
expression of their intent for this program.** Read it early to internalize *what we
build* (manual §1–§2) — and *how the user wants it driven*: to realize the
program's **full capability** (manual §5 is the capability-maximization playbook;
§3/§4/§6 show how the machine interconnects). When a decision trades off against
realizing that full capability, **surface it rather than silently making the call.**
Keep the manual true as the code evolves (same staleness discipline as `ARCHITECTURE.md`).

# Impact analysis before editing

Before modifying a function, class, or method, gauge its blast radius with
grep + Read (the de-facto method across every session to date):

- `grep -rn 'symbolName' --include='*.py' .` to find the definition + callers;
  Read the call sites; grep imports for cross-file references.
- Report the direct callers + risk to the user before editing a high-fanout
  symbol.
- Before committing, run `git show --stat` / `git diff` to confirm the changed
  scope matches intent.

For renames / extracts / splits: grep the symbol across the repo first
(callers, imports, string references), update every site, then re-grep to
confirm none remain. Don't find-and-replace blind to the call graph.

# Verification discipline (R-EVIDENCE)
Scope: both
Trigger: making any specific factual/inventory claim — "N files", "Y functions",
"Z tests", "N LOC", "present in <path>", "absent from <path>", "X is unused".
Action: cite the producing command's output in the same change (paste command +
output, or `verified via $ <cmd> → <result>`). A command scoped to one path proves
only that path — re-run at the wider scope before making a wider claim. If you
cannot run the verifying command, label the claim **unverified** rather than
asserting it. Never apply authority-voice over an unverified factual claim.
Evidence: the command + its output, in the doc/commit body (cite or don't claim).
Details: docs/protocol/agents/core.md (ADR-013; the 24-vs-1 origin story).

# Measurement-as-artifact (R-MEASURE)
Scope: both
Trigger: recording a number that backs a GO/NO-GO verdict, a gate threshold,
or a spec/record claim (arc scores, VRAM peaks, prices, durations, counts).
Action: the number must be produced by a COMMITTED script/command and
persisted to (or directly citable from) a `logs/` artifact in the same change
that records it. Ad-hoc runtime measurements may be recorded only when
explicitly labeled estimate / runtime-unreproducible. Extends R-EVIDENCE from
"cite the command" to "commit the instrument".
Evidence: script path + `logs/` artifact cited next to the number.
Details: docs/PROTOCOL-RULES-LOG.md (R-MEASURE entry; origin = the 2026-06-11
half-crop numbers that backed S2/S3 verdicts from REPL-only measurement).

# Verification tiering (R-VERIFY-TIER)
Scope: both
Trigger: about to launch a 3rd+ independent verification pass on a claim two seats
already confirmed; OR confirming a code defect you are NOT fixing this session.
Action: (A) For doc-only notes about an already-known/deferred defect, convergence =
TWO independent seats confirming the same file:line claims (a Rule #23 co-sign counts
as one). A 3rd pass is allowed ONLY for a genuinely different question, stated before
launch. Does NOT relax per-commit production-code verification (Lane V / Rule #9).
(B) An agent-confirmed defect left unfixed this session must ship a
`pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True, reason=...)` pin in the same session, or be labeled
`test-infeasible` with a one-line reason in the handoff — so CI, not the next
session's agents, re-verifies.
Evidence: the stated new question for any 3rd pass; the xfail pin (or test-infeasible label).
Details: docs/protocol/agents/core.md (R-VERIFY-TIER); origin = audit wf_6be2ee18-f4b
(the §8.5 char-landscape note drew ~25-31 agent-runs across 4 passes for one doc paragraph).

# Multi-task orchestration (R-ORCH)
Scope: both
Trigger: a plan with ≥5 independent sub-tasks OR ≥800 LOC of total change; or a
user-referenced plan file under `docs/superpowers/plans/`.
Action: orchestrate — do NOT implement in main context. Main holds the plan + task
state + a short summary per task; a fresh-context implementer (new subagent / new
chat session) does each task, then a spec review + a code-quality review of the
actual diff per task. **Never run two implementers in parallel on shared files**
(sequential only); reviews go after implementation. A single change OR
tightly-coupled work → stay in main context.
Evidence: one commit per task (clean BASE..HEAD range); task state.
Details: docs/protocol/agents/orchestration.md; prompt body in docs/templates/agents/.

# Implementation safety rules (specific, repeatedly useful — tied to prior CRITICALs)

## R-BRIEF — brief-pattern adherence
Scope: both
Trigger: a brief says "mirror pattern X at file:line" or "use the existing _foo_-style endpoint".
Action: verify the FULL shape of X (signature, route path, scope params, error
handling, lock guards) before implementing — brief-pattern references are implicit
specs. If the reference names a canonical site/SHA, brief-pattern references are
runtime claims when they cite canonical sites: verify the named symbol exists at
the cited SHA and verify the cited SHA exhibits the named sub-pattern. If the
named helper doesn't exist or the wording is ambiguous, report the divergence
BEFORE implementing.
Details: docs/protocol/agents/director-operator.md (composes with Rule #12).

## R-PID — pid-scope endpoint check
Scope: both
Trigger: adding/touching an HTTP endpoint on a project-scoped resource (any domain entity keyed by project ID).
Action: verify the route takes `<pid>` explicitly. Do NOT scan a list-all to find a
matching resource — IDs collide across projects. Inspect a sibling endpoint to
confirm route shape + scoping.
Details: docs/protocol/agents/director-operator.md (Rule #13).

## R-SKILL — project-skill load triggers
Scope: both
<!-- TODO(<PROJECT>): add this project domain-skill triggers -->
Trigger: about to author, modify, review, or debug domain-specific graph/pipeline code or an external-API client for a major project subsystem.
Action: invoke the matching project skill BEFORE writing or judging the code. When a skill prior shapes a verdict, name it in the work product.
Details: .agents/skills/<domain-skill>/SKILL.md.

## Rule #12 — grep-the-writes
Scope: both
Trigger: a brief names a schema field / dict key / mutator / write-path as a target of new code.
Action: grep the production WRITE site (not just the type declaration) to prove the
symbol is populated at runtime — type-declaration is not write-evidence. Cite the grep.
For canonical pattern references, verify the named symbol exists at the cited
SHA and verify the cited SHA exhibits the named sub-pattern.
Details: docs/protocol/agents/director-operator.md (Rule #12).

## Rule #13 — symmetric-endpoint audit
Scope: both
Trigger: adding/modifying an endpoint that bypasses a fence, gates on a persistent
flag, or touches shared state other endpoints touch.
Action: audit ALL sibling endpoints on the same fence/flag/state for parallel checks
the new one should mirror — and for checks the existing ones may be missing; fold the
fix or document the exemption. audit-completeness is not audit-disposition:
enumerating siblings is incomplete until you state the disposition for each
sibling as mirror / defer / document / exempt.
Details: docs/protocol/agents/director-operator.md (Rule #13).

# Director–Operator concurrent operation (minimal model)

Four agent sessions (two pairs) run in parallel by design — **director-seats** (strategy, briefs,
ADRs, push decisions) and **operator-seats** (independent post-commit verification,
doc-sync, mailbox reports). Four seats / two pairs of one team; specialization, not hierarchy;
all serve the user-principal. A `coordinator` pseudo-seat is spawned **on demand** at
multi-pair-wrap boundaries for read-only cross-pair audit — not a standing concurrent
seat (see `docs/protocol/agents/four-seat-extension.md`). Load-bearing invariants:

- **User is principal.** User direct instructions override everything.
- **Authority precedence:** user > git commits (durable record) > mailbox `sent/`
  events (bind the receiving seat — Rule #8) > STATE.md (stale cache) > default.
- **Git is the tiebreaker.** Before acting on a shared task, run `git log --oneline -3`;
  the first commit to land wins.
- **Signal via artifacts** (mailbox event / presence file), not chat alone.
- **Codex mailbox freshness:** always check mail before a Codex
  live-seat/coordinator handoff, routing event, protocol decision, or
  state-asserting protocol write. Read live mailbox state from the relevant
  `seat_status.py ... --wave <N>` command and recent
  `coordination/mailbox/sent/` entries, then read the relevant mailbox bodies
  instead of deciding from counts alone. A bare `handoff` request means a narrow
  state-transfer artifact unless the user explicitly asks for implementation or
  verification.

Full governance — Rules #7–#23, the disagreement protocol, emergency handling, phase
taxonomy, and mailbox protocol — lives in **docs/protocol/agents/director-operator.md**;
read it only when coordinating with the other seat. Rule provenance (codified SHAs,
empirical basis, beneficiary/consent) is in docs/PROTOCOL-RULES-LOG.md.

- **Pair Operating Contract:** efficient pair work is the short director ->
  operator artifact loop. Director scopes the smallest sufficient
  brief/fix/verify-request; operator verifies only the named artifact or landed
  commit; all baton passes are a mailbox artifact, not chat; no duplicate Lane V
  for docs/status/handoff-only commits; No receipt/status churn unless it
  changes ownership, preserves evidence, requests verification, returns
  GO/NITS/FAIL, or blocks on user-gated side effects; first commit to land wins
  after git/mailbox refresh; close the loop with an operator verification-report
  GO/NITS/FAIL and an exact next trigger.

- **Rule #23 co-sign is TIERED** (Lever #7, audit `wf_6be2ee18-f4b`; body in
  `docs/protocol/agents/director-operator.md`). Classifier: *would the
  co-signer's verification change which files/sites the implementation touches?*
  **Tier A** (yes) = co-signer lands a mailbox `verification-report` BEFORE dispatch
  (async-OK via workflow+mailbox, no session restart). **Tier B** (no) = awareness
  heads-up, 48h proceed-if-no-objection. Unsure → Tier A.

# Protocol Optimizations & Session Lessons (ADR-027)

The following optimizations and guardrails emerged from real session forensics (Session-12 / ADR-027) to resolve friction in multi-seat concurrent loops. Apply these continuously:

## R-HOT-TREE (Re-verify on Hot Shared Tree)
Scope: both
Trigger: acting on a repository where peer seats are concurrently active.
Action: Never trust a refs snapshot older than your last step. The HEAD can move multiple times during a single burst of work. Always execute `git log --oneline -3` and check the latest mailbox events right before writing your commit or making a gate decision.

## R-WIP-POLLUTION (Live Peer WIP in Working Tree)
Scope: both
Trigger: observing uncommitted changes to shared files (e.g., `ARCHITECTURE.md`, the main orchestrator module) that you did not author.
Action: Do NOT run auto-fix scripts (like `check_doc_claims.py --fix`) mid-burst over a peer's WIP. The lane owner is strictly responsible for fixing anchors upon touch (R-START). To avoid accidental pollution, always use `env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE` and strict pathspecs when staging commits.

## R-GATE-EVIDENCE (Gate Met ≠ Correctness Proof)
Scope: coordinator
Trigger: determining if a Wave Gate has been met.
Action: Do not cite `wave_gate_check` output alone as `R-EVIDENCE`. The gate script reads the inventory string, it does not execute tests. To claim correctness, you MUST cite the underlying executed regression pins or the operator's formal GO event.

## R-VERIFY-THEN-PUSH
Scope: director / coordinator
Trigger: deciding whether to push production code to origin.
Action: Never push pre-GO. Pushing unverified fixes risks NITS arriving directly on the remote origin, fracturing the verification history. Always wait for the operator's verification GO before executing the push.

# Coordinating with CLAUDE.md

This file (`AGENTS.md`) and `CLAUDE.md` are sibling documents. They share
the Architecture Preamble. They diverge on tooling specifics:

| Topic | This file (AGENTS.md) | CLAUDE.md |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture + invariants | ✓ (canonical) | ✓ (canonical, identical) |
| Multi-task discipline | ✓ Universal principles | ✓ Same principles + Claude tool syntax |
| Lane A/B/C heuristic | ✓ Universal | ✓ Same |
| Prompt templates | ✓ Universal skeleton | ✓ Same + Claude-specific examples |
| Tool syntax (`Agent`, `Skill`, `TaskCreate`) | — | ✓ Claude Code only |
| `superpowers:*` skill invocation | — | ✓ Claude Code only |
| `AskUserQuestion` discipline | — | ✓ Claude Code only |

**If a Claude Code agent reads both files** and the guidance differs, the
order of precedence is:
1. The user-principal's explicit instructions (highest)
2. `CLAUDE.md` Claude-specific extensions
3. This file's universal principles
4. The model's default behavior (lowest)

**If a non-Claude agent reads only this file:** the universal principles
above are complete and standalone. Apply them with your tool's analogous
mechanisms. The `CLAUDE.md` references are optional reading.
