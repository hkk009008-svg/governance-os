# PostToolUse hook: regenerates STATE.md on HEAD moves + stamps presence.
#
# B-003 Option E (cycle 8, 2026-05-26) replaced this script's prior
# "amend STATE.md into the just-made commit" model with the much simpler
# "STATE.md is gitignored, regenerate it on disk only" model. The historical
# rationale for amending — making commit history reflect repository state —
# was already leaky (B-002 stale-by-one: STATE.md inside any commit was one
# SHA behind because it was generated pre-amend) AND produced B-003 (compound
# `git commit && git push` left local diverged from origin because the hook
# fired after the push). Option E retires both failure modes by accepting
# that STATE.md is purely-local informational state; it never enters commits
# again. See `docs/B-003-design-exploration.md` for the full analysis.
#
# Behavior:
# - Runs on every PostToolUse: Bash|Write|Edit tool call.
# - Presence auto-freshness (v5.7 M1): stamps the seat's presence file
#   (head_at_write + updated) on EVERY call, before the skip-perf gate, so
#   liveness updates during non-committing work. Seat resolution: CLAUDE_SEAT
#   env (preferred) ELSE a per-session marker `.claude/presence-seat.<session-id>`
#   (hardening 2026-06-06) so a session launched without CLAUDE_SEAT still
#   stamps presence instead of silently no-opping. The hook NEVER writes
#   `current_task` or `status` (those are agent-owned per Rule #19).
# - Skip-perf gate: exits early if HEAD hasn't moved since last run AND
#   STATE.md still exists on disk. Marker stored at
#   `.claude/hooks/.last-state-head` (gitignored).
# - On a HEAD move (commit, reset, checkout, rebase, etc.), regenerates
#   STATE.md from current git state + mailbox cursors.
# - STATE.md is gitignored; this hook never touches git history.
#
# This hook is configured via `.claude/settings.local.json`'s
# PostToolUse: Bash|Write|Edit matcher.

# v5.8 — per-seat index auto-refresh (D-a). The peer's commits move shared

# Safety: read-tree fires ONLY in C1, where the index byte-equals a tree

# v5.9 — skip-worktree pollution auto-clear. Harness child processes
# (Workflow/subagent runs) have twice left skip-worktree bits in the active
# index (N=4; then N=767 of 844 tracked, 2026-06-10) — `git status` then
# hides this seat's OWN edits and add/rm fail with phantom "sparse-checkout"
# errors although no sparse checkout is configured. Trigger op still
# unreproduced (plain and worktree-isolated 1-agent probes both came back
# clean, 2026-06-11) — hence detect-and-clear here rather than a fix at the
# source, plus a log line per event to build the evidence trail.
# Safety: no legitimate skip-worktree use exists in this repo, so ANY flagged
# entry is pollution. `update-index --no-skip-worktree` flips ONLY the flag
# bit — staged content is untouched (pinned by test), unlike the manual
# wholesale `git read-tree HEAD` fix, which destroys staged work. Targets
# whatever index this process resolves (the per-seat GIT_INDEX_FILE under
# D-a, else the default) — exactly the index a polluting child inherits.
# Deliberately NOT gated on GIT_INDEX_FILE, and runs BEFORE the skip-perf
# gate: pollution arrives WITHOUT a HEAD move.
