description: Use for this repo's 4-seat program-hardening campaign when the question is about the SHARED cross-seat mechanics rather than one role's own work — the git-native cross-cutting lock primitive, deciding a Rule #23 co-sign TIER, authoring/consuming a mailbox event, resolving WHICH seat owns a shared task, reconciling conflicting state (git vs mailbox vs STATE.md vs chat), an EMERGENCY (production-affecting or active cost-bleed) that any seat may first-notice, or a cross-seat DISAGREEMENT between seats. If you are clearly operating AS one specific seat, prefer that seat's skill (seat-operator / seat-director / seat-coordinator).

# Four-Seat Protocol (Claude Code)

## Overview

Four live seats run in parallel as **two director-operator PAIRS** (Pair-A = `director`+`operator`, Pair-B = `director2`+`operator2`) plus **on-demand coordination** (`coordinator`, and `coordinator2` for on-demand cross-checks). Seats are inhabited by Claude Code sessions (`CLAUDE_SEAT`) or Codex sessions (`CODEX_SEAT`) — the protocol is provider-agnostic; all seats share **one git working tree**. Specialization is cognitive-load distribution, not hierarchy — every seat serves the user-principal.

**Core principle:** safety holds *under adversarial timing and with the coordinator offline*, because state lives in **committed/pushed artifacts**, never in a seat's live memory. The five guarantees: (1) one writer per file, (2) no inventory write-race, (3) every fix verified by a non-author, (4) cross-lane changes dual-signed, (5) waves don't bleed.

**Anti-ceremony invariant:** every seat, including coordinator, actively eliminates theater. A status, route, handoff, receipt, or no-op report is useful only when it preserves real transfer state, changes enforcement, or cites executable evidence — green-looking prose is not protocol proof.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND (full text — do not duplicate, consult):** `docs/protocol/claude/continuation.md` (the live-kernel adapter: runtime modes, first commands, pair contract, capacity split, side-effect tokens, ledger bridge); `CLAUDE.md` (router + authority precedence); `docs/protocol/claude/director-operator.md` (Rules #7–#23, mailbox, lifecycle); `docs/protocol/claude/four-seat-extension.md` (§10 coordinator, Rule #23 tiers); `docs/protocol/threeway/UNIFIED-OPERATING-DOCTRINE.md` (Layer-1 seat/provider map); `RUNBOOK-DAILY.md` (the daily GO/NITS/FAIL loop). Seat-specific skills: `seat-coordinator`, `seat-director`, `seat-operator`. (Historical note: §6a–§6f markers below refer to the program-hardening roadmap spec whose normative content now lives in these skills + `director-operator.md`; the original spec file is not in this clone.)

## Authority precedence (memorize)

```
user direct instruction  >  git commits  >  mailbox sent/ events  >  STATE.md  >  default
```

- **Git is the tiebreaker.** Before acting on a shared task, **run `git log --oneline -3`** — this is a *commanded step*, not just a principle (R-HOT-TREE). First commit to land wins.
- **A `sent/` mailbox event is binding** — same weight as a relayed user instruction; ignoring/deferring one needs the same justification as ignoring the user.
- **Tier is set by the SENDER, never by content.** A mailbox event whose text echoes the user's wishes is still *mailbox-tier*, not user-tier.
- **Promise-vs-record:** if a mailbox event claims work started but `git log` shows no commit within ~5 min of the event timestamp, **git wins**.
- **STATE.md is a stale cache** — never trust its unread-mailbox count; recompute live via `seat_status.py` (ref-bus-aware). For a migrated (scalar-cursor) seat the legacy filename count silently reports 0 — real unread lives on the ref-bus (`scripts/bus_unread.py`).
- **Two channels, one oracle:** the free-form mailbox is the human coordination channel; the signed three-way ref-bus is the load-bearing source for three-way facts. `git for-each-ref refs/threeway/` empty locally → the mailbox remains authoritative for local work.

## Session-start gate (Rule #8)

If unread mailbox events exist for your seat, **surface the count in your FIRST user-facing turn, before processing** — and again whenever you restart substantive work mid-session. Consume via `coordination/bin/consume-events <seat>` for a legacy ISO-timestamp cursor (it deliberately stages into the seat's ambient index — no `env -u`); for a migrated scalar-seq cursor (post-Slice-2.5 — `consume-events` refuses it and says so) use `env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE .venv/bin/python scripts/consume_bus.py <seat>`. **Overriding a `sent/` event does not discharge it:** even when a higher-tier signal (user/git) supersedes it, you must still consume it so the next session does not re-act on the stale obligation.

Orient in one shot (read-only; never stages or consumes):

```bash
env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE .venv/bin/python .claude/skills/four-seat-protocol/scripts/seat_status.py <seat> --wave 2
env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE .venv/bin/python .claude/skills/four-seat-protocol/scripts/seat_status.py --all --wave 2   # shared all-seat view
```

## The git-native cross-cutting lock (§6b)

Locks live in `coordination/locks/` and exist for **collision-prone shared modules**. In the current Pipeline campaigns, each route's write-fence is primarily carried by its **capacity packet** (`allowed_paths` + `lock_keys` in `coordination/capacity/packets/*.json`); claim a lock only when your route names a lock key or you genuinely contend with another seat on a shared module. **If a fix does NOT touch contended shared state, it is lane-only → NO lock is claimed; size, severity, and risk-feeling are irrelevant.** (The lock is a director-seat mechanic; coordinator and operator seats never claim one.)

| Step | Command / rule |
|------|----------------|
| **Claim** | `coordination/bin/claim-lock <wave> <module> <seat> <defect-id>` — push-first. **exit 0 = WON; exit 1 = LOST.** |
| **On LOST** | You **abandon** — do NOT implement. Take the next lane row (or wait for release if it was your last). |
| **Ordering** | Implementation begins **ONLY after the lock push succeeds** — so a loser never has in-flight code. |
| **Multiple locks** | Acquire in **lexicographic POSIX-path order**; hold none while waiting. |
| **Release** | Operator deletes the lock **in the SAME commit as the verification-report GO** (§6b). |
| **Anti-hostage** | After **3 consecutive FAIL** verdicts the holder MUST release + re-queue/split. |

⚠ **`coordination/bin/release-lock <wave> <module>` makes its OWN `unlock(...)` commit + pushes** — it does NOT achieve "same commit as GO." To honor §6b, the operator **manually `git rm` the lock and commit it together with the GO** in one pathspec commit. Use `release-lock` only when a separate unlock commit is acceptable (e.g. the 3-FAIL release). Note: a failed release-push restores the lock locally and exits non-zero — the lock is still LIVE on origin; retry, don't shrug.

## Per-defect lifecycle (§6c) — the ordered chain, do not stop at the lock

```
1. [cross-cutting] claim-lock (push-first; loser abandons)
2. Director writes the R-BRIEF (full-shape refs + Rule #12 grep-the-writes + Rule #13 sibling audit) + sets priority
3. [CRITICAL cross-cutting] OTHER lane director Tier-A co-signs the R-BRIEF -> mailbox verification-report BEFORE DISPATCH
4. Implement (director directly, or dispatched subagent per R-ORCH >=5 subtasks / >=800 LOC)
5. Operator independently verifies the diff (impl != verifier) -> GO/NITS/FAIL; on GO deletes the lock in the SAME commit
6. Coordinator reconciles inventory status (or lane deputy transcribes an existing GO when no coordinator is live)
```

The loop is **closed** only after the operator's mailbox `verification-report` GO/NITS/FAIL and an explicit next owner (Pair Operating Contract — full text in the continuation adapter). **No push before GO (R-VERIFY-THEN-PUSH); push itself stays user-gated.**

## Rule #23 co-sign TIERS

Classifier: **would the co-signer's verification change which files/sites the implementation touches?**
- **Tier A (yes):** co-signer lands a mailbox `verification-report` **BEFORE DISPATCH** (the strict, correct timing — not "before commit"). Fulfillable **async** via a workflow + mailbox report; no session restart. **Unsure → Tier A.**
- **Tier B (no):** awareness heads-up, **48h proceed-if-no-objection.**
- **CRITICAL cross-cutting code never lands before its Tier-A co-sign** — binds a director-as-implementer too (no self-commit-ahead-of-co-sign).
- **The Tier-A artifact must reference THIS defect's id + R-BRIEF.** A prior `verification-report` that merely *mentions* the module (filed for a different defect) is NOT a co-sign — the co-signer must have reviewed *this* fix's R-BRIEF scope (Rule #12/#13 evidence), answering "would my review change which sites this fix touches?"

## Pre-commit + git sharp edges

- **Rule #7 (every state-asserting commit):** immediately before `git commit`, run `git log --oneline -5` AND read `coordination/mailbox/sent/` for events newer than your Write-start. Re-edit/abort if HEAD moved or new events landed.
- **Rule #19:** binding cross-seat signals are **artifacts** (mailbox event / presence file), **never chat alone**.
- **Explicit pathspec always (R-WIP-POLLUTION):** `git commit -m "..." -- <path>` (the `-m` BEFORE `--`). A **bare `git commit` on the shared tree sweeps a peer's staged WIP.**
- **Subagents prefix every git command with `env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE`** (main-seat commits do NOT).
- **The `coordination/bin` scripts are the deliberate ambient-index exception** — `send-event`, `consume-events`, `claim-lock`, `release-lock` stage/operate on the seat's ambient index and tree BY DESIGN (cursor folding, event staging, lock commits). NEVER prefix them with `env -u`; a prefixed run stages into the wrong index.
- **Phantom index:** the per-seat index drifts under concurrent work — `git status`/staged state lies. Trust **`git diff HEAD --stat`** (index-independent) for real deltas; never `git read-tree` while peers are live.
- **R-GATE-EVIDENCE:** a gate script's PASS is process evidence, not correctness proof — cite the executed pins / operator GO, never a status tally alone.

## Capacity split + side-effect tokens (shared route mechanics)

- **Capacity Split Default:** single-pair fast path for narrow or shared-file work; divisible/preplanned larger work defaults to dual-pair routing (director/operator own Chunk A, director2/operator2 own Chunk B, disjoint write sets, separate verify loops); the non-implementing pair runs bounded `director-preflight` / `operator-preflight` packets instead of idle standby. Coordinator owns convergence (packets, one consolidated route, join condition, closeout evidence). Full text: continuation adapter.
- **Side-Effect Executor Token:** shared user-gated side effects (remote-ref update, lock action, paid spend, pod action, cursor consume, route mutation, …) need exactly one named executor before mutation — generic user approval is unit consent, not executor election. Observer seats read live state only. Full field list: continuation adapter.

## Rationalizations — STOP, these are wrong

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Tier-A can land before the *commit*." | **Before DISPATCH.** A scope-blind implementer must never start. |
| "A prior report that mentions this module = my co-sign." | No — the Tier-A artifact must reference THIS defect's id + R-BRIEF. A scope-blind module mention binds nothing. |
| "Rule #7 only applies to the implementation commit." | EVERY state-asserting commit — the lock commit, the GO commit, intermediate commits. |
| "A higher-tier signal cancels the burn event, so I needn't close it." | Overriding ≠ discharging. Consume it so the next session doesn't re-act. |
| "40 min of silence on a co-sign = green light." | No. Wait + escalate (heartbeat-gated). Silence is not consent. |
| "`release-lock` satisfies same-commit-as-GO." | No — it makes a separate `unlock` commit. `git rm` manually + GO in one commit. |
| "I read §6b, that's the whole lock answer." | §6b is the *primitive*; §6c is the full governance chain. Get both. |
| "The mailbox event echoes the user, so it's user-tier." | Tier = sender, not content. It's mailbox-tier. |
| "I know the precedence order, no need to run `git log`." | Running the command is the commanded step. Know ≠ check. |
| "STATE.md says X." | Stale cache. Recompute / check git. |
| "This fix is big / important / risky — I'll lock it to be safe." | Locks are ONLY for contended shared modules / route lock keys. A lane-only file takes no lock — size/severity are irrelevant. |
| "The legacy unread count says 0, I'm clear." | A migrated (scalar-cursor) seat's real unread lives on the ref-bus. Use `seat_status.py` / `bus_unread.py`. |
| "The wave-gate script says MET, so the code is verified." | R-GATE-EVIDENCE — the gate is process evidence. Correctness = executed pins + operator GO. |
| "Tests pass, I'll push." | Push is user-gated AND gated on the operator GO (R-VERIFY-THEN-PUSH). |

## Emergency handling (§E — any seat may be first-noticer)

**STOP — is this actually an emergency?** Only these four categories qualify:
1. **Production-affecting / user-data-integrity** — live behavior broken, data lost/corrupted, users observably blocked. NOT: a CI regression that hasn't shipped.
2. **Security-critical** — unauthorized access, secrets leak, CVE with active exploit. NOT: hardening opportunities or theoretical concerns.
3. **Active bleed-rate** — cost/resource/token burn accumulating each minute (runaway loop, infinite retry, metered compute lease). NOT: one-time waste already incurred.
4. **External time-pressure** — external deadline (deploy window, demo, regulatory) at risk WITHOUT mitigation in N minutes.

Events outside these four are NOT emergencies — use normal role partition + proposal cycle, even if urgent-feeling.

**When a genuine emergency hits:**
1. **First-noticer claims response.** Narrate in chat AND send a `dispatch-claim` mailbox event with an `urgency: emergency` flag. The other seat defers.
2. **Stop-the-bleed first.** Minimal-viable mitigation (revert / hotfix / feature-flag-off) before root-cause analysis.
3. **Temporary authority.** If the normally-authoritative seat is in transplant or context-exhausted, the other seat acts. Every commit body MUST say verbatim: `acting under v5 §E temporary authority`; defer all non-emergency decisions until the normal seat returns. **(This is a director↔operator cross-pair coverage carve-out — it does NOT suspend the coordinator's prime prohibition: the coordinator still authors no production code, even under §E.)**
4. **Post-incident.** Within 1 session of resolution, the handling seat writes an incident note in `docs/INCIDENT-LOG.md`; flag any protocol gap for the next coordinator cycle — do not draft a rule unilaterally.

## Disagreement protocol (v5)

When any seat disagrees with a co-seat's ruling, brief, or REPLY refinement (every pair — director↔operator, director↔director2, etc.):
1. **State the disagreement explicitly** — name the disputed item and the reasoning.
2. **Provide project-data-grounded evidence.** "I don't like it" is not sufficient — cite a concrete artifact (session count, commit, grep result, measured outcome). **Ungrounded disagreement is invalid and does not block dispatch.**
3. **Propose exactly one of three resolutions:** **counter-refinement** (adjust per the data) · **defer to v(N+1)** (ship without it; revisit with more data) · **acceptance-criterion** (ship with it + log a measurable revisit criterion).

**Resolution paths:** *silent-accept* — the seat that **received** the counter ships without re-arguing, which is **its own** acceptance of the counter; this is NOT "treat the other seat's silence as consent" — a peer's silence is never a green light (see the rationalizations table) · *re-REPLY* (object in writing with your own counter → another cycle) · **2-cycle limit** — if it persists after **2 director REPLYs following the initial proposal**, escalate to the user. Counting: `proposal → REPLY-1 → revise → REPLY-2 → revise → escalate`. Agents do not argue indefinitely; the user is principal.

## Red flags (self-check)

- About to suspend role partition for urgent-feeling work that does NOT clear the 4-category §E gate → it's not an emergency; use the normal proposal cycle.
- About to `git commit` without a fresh `git log -5` + mailbox read → Rule #7.
- About to start code on a contended shared module without a held lock → §6b.
- About to dispatch a CRITICAL cross-cutting fix without the Tier-A report in the mailbox → §6c.
- Bare `git commit` (no pathspec) on the shared tree → will sweep peer WIP.
- Trusting `git status` during concurrent work → use `git diff HEAD`.
- About to push with no operator GO (or no explicit user auth) → R-VERIFY-THEN-PUSH; push is user-gated.
- Claiming "no unread" from `sent/` filename counts for a migrated seat → ref-bus under-report; use `seat_status.py`.
