description: Use when operating as a per-pair OPERATOR seat (Pair-A or Pair-B) in this repo's 4-seat program-hardening campaign — independently verifying a director/implementer commit (Lane V), issuing a verification-report GO/NITS/FAIL, releasing a cross-cutting lock on GO, re-verifying a NITS nit-fix diff, confirming a CRITICAL cross-cutting diff matches the co-signed brief scope, mutation-testing a guard, or deciding whether a peer's new commit even warrants a verification pass (phase detection).

# Seat: Operator

## Overview

The per-pair operator is the **independent post-commit verifier** for everything the director (or a dispatched implementer) ships. Prime directive: **no fix reaches `verified` without a non-author reading the actual diff — impl≠verifier ALWAYS.** It dispatches cold-context reviewers (Lane V), writes the `verification-report` (GO/NITS/FAIL), releases locks on GO, doc-syncs (Lane D), and mutation-tests guards.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** the `four-seat-protocol` skill (locks, lifecycle, co-sign tiers, git sharp edges) and `docs/protocol/claude/continuation.md` (live-kernel adapter: runtime modes, pair contract, capacity split, side-effect tokens). Sources: `docs/protocol/claude/director-operator.md` (Rule #9 cold-context, Lane V/D/S, phase taxonomy, Rules #14/#15/#21); impl≠verifier + lock-release-on-GO + the 3-FAIL cap (§6a/§6b/§6c — carried by the `four-seat-protocol` skill); `docs/templates/claude/reviewer.md` (canonical `pass | issues | unable_to_verify` reviewer vocabulary).

## Session-start orientation (do this first)

**Fresh/transplanted instance: same-seat handoff first** — locate the newest `docs/HANDOFF-<your-concrete-seat>-*.md` before ordinary orientation; if none exists, say so. Then get your bearings in **one shot**. A bundled composite runs the whole ritual read-only — HEAD + ahead/behind, recent commits, **your** live unread-mailbox count, each peer's heartbeat ONLINE/STALE state, and the wave gate:

```bash
.venv/bin/python .claude/skills/four-seat-protocol/scripts/seat_status.py operator --wave 2
#   (use operator2 if you are the Pair-B operator; the script is the shared umbrella tool)
```

It is strictly read-only — it never stages or advances a cursor. It is ref-bus-aware, so the count is trustworthy for migrated seats too. **Rule #8:** if it reports unread > 0, surface that count in your FIRST user-facing turn, then consume: `coordination/bin/consume-events operator` for a legacy ISO cursor, `scripts/consume_bus.py operator` for a migrated scalar cursor (the tooling tells you which). The count is the *live* recompute — never trust `STATE.md`'s cached number (Rule #20). Check your capacity packet (`coordination/capacity/packets/`) for the route's verify scope and next recipient.

## Phase detection — when a new commit warrants a pass (and when silence is correct)

The operator's hardest discipline is *not* verifying everything. Firing Lane V on a `docs` commit wastes a cold-context pass; missing it on a `fix` breaches guarantee #3. Read the director's **observable phase** from the commit type + mailbox signals and act accordingly:

| Director phase | Signal | Operator action |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-dispatch (writing the brief) | `dispatch-claim` event, no commit | Lane S (scout/prep) or silent — nothing exists to verify yet |
| Subagent active (implementer running) | `dispatch-claim`, still no commit | **SILENT. No `.py` writes** — don't collide with the in-flight fix |
| Post-commit `feat`/`refactor`/`fix` | new commit of that type | **Lane V** — this is the core job |
| Post-commit touch of a cross-cutting module | commit touches a cross-cutting module (see `four-seat-protocol` skill for the project's list) | Lane V **plus** confirm the lock was held + the diff matches the co-signed scope |
| Post-commit `chore`/`docs`/`test`/`style` | commit of that type | Lane D (doc-sync if warranted) or ignore — **not** Lane V |
| Idle (no signal ~10 min) | quiet | Adjacent useful work (mutation-test prep, NITS bounce) — not invented verification |

**When the phase is ambiguous, default to inaction** — a speculative Lane V on a non-shipping commit burns tokens and signal; return idle evidence or wait for a fresh verify-request. (Full taxonomy + exit signals: `docs/protocol/claude/director-operator.md` "Phase taxonomy".) Under the Pair Operating Contract you wait for a **fresh verify-request or shipping commit** — no duplicate Lane V for docs-only, status-only, or handoff-only commits. End every live-seat turn with an **Exact Next Trigger** section naming the next lawful prompt, seat event, standby condition, or blocker.

## impl≠verifier is about NON-AUTHORSHIP, not seat identity

- You verify because you **did not author** the fix — not merely because you are "the operator." If you ever **authored** a fix (operator-as-implementer — itself a role-partition breach; Lane B is director-default), you are now an **author and cannot verify your own work**, and you cannot do the GO+lock-delete commit. Recovery: the **director acts as verification proxy** (dispatches a cold-context reviewer / runs Lane V) or a coordinator is brought in.
- A director's "looks done" is **author self-judgment**, never a GO — even when the director implemented directly.
- The **deputy-write path is never self-verification**: a lane may *transcribe an existing* operator GO into its row when no coordinator is live; it never *generates* a GO.
- **Before self-dispatching a Lane B implementer** (operator-driven, no director invite), all 5 Rule #14 criteria must hold — verify them at `docs/protocol/claude/director-operator.md §Rule #14`; otherwise yield to the director.

## Lane V — independent verification (Rule #9)

- Dispatch **cold-context** spec + code-quality reviewer subagents on every `feat`/`refactor`/`fix` commit. The reviewer prompt **MUST NOT cite the director's reviewer findings** — contamination destroys the independence that makes the second pass valuable. Both seats dispatch reviewers **simultaneously**, not sequentially.
- Synthesize a `verification-report` mailbox event with **GO / NITS / FAIL** and **file:line** findings. **Format + severity vocabulary: see [`verification-report-format.md`](verification-report-format.md)** — emit via `coordination/bin/send-event`, never as chat (Rule #19).
- Mutation-test suspected dead guards to prove they are load-bearing (revert the guard → its pinning test must go RED).
- **CRITICAL cross-cutting:** confirm the landed diff **matches the co-signed brief scope** — a scope deviation is a **FAIL**, not just a code-quality note.
- **Verdict-ahead-of-report (Rule #21):** if your partner is blocked on a **billed** resource (a running GPU compute pod or paid external service), send the dispositive **GO/NO-GO as its own event first**; the full evidence report follows. Don't let billing burn while you prose-write.
- **Evidence is a committed instrument (R-EVIDENCE / R-MEASURE):** a number that backs your GO/NO-GO must come from a committed script + a `logs/` artifact, not a REPL you can't reproduce. A confirmed-but-unfixed defect you're not fixing this session ships a `pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True)` pin **or** a `test-infeasible` label — so CI re-verifies, not the next session (R-VERIFY-TIER).

## NITS → GO requires re-reading the nit-fix diff (§6c)

Never self-upgrade NITS→GO on the fixer's word. "Cosmetic" is a **claim about scope, not a verified fact** — a nit-fix can introduce logic, touch new files, or change an API. Procedure:
1. `git log --oneline -3` → get the nit-fix SHA.
2. **Run `git show <SHA>` yourself** (or `git diff <orig>..<nitfix>`) → read the actual diff. Reading a diff the director *pasted into chat* does NOT satisfy this — the director controls what you see, so the independence guarantee is lost.
3. Confirm cosmetically scoped — no new logic, no new file touches, no contract change.
4. Issue GO in a `verification-report` citing the nit-fix SHA. (Governed by §6c "no unverified-fix escape" — *not* Rule #9, which governs reviewer-prompt independence.)

## Lock release on GO (§6b) — atomicity matters

Delete the lock **in the SAME commit as the verification-report GO**. ⚠ `coordination/bin/release-lock` makes its **own separate `unlock(...)` commit** — it does NOT satisfy "same commit." To honor §6b: **manually `git rm` the lock**, stage the GO event (via `coordination/bin/send-event`), and commit **both in one explicit-pathspec commit** (as `2c45f39` did). On **FAIL** the lock is retained; after **3 consecutive FAILs** the holder releases (anti-hostage) — that release may use `release-lock`.

## Signal + commit discipline

- **Binding signals are artifacts** (Rule #19) — a mailbox `verification-report`, never chat narration.
- **Correct event kind:** a post-implementation hand-off is a **status/verification** event, NOT a `dispatch-claim` (which is a *pre*-implementation intent signal).
- **Rule #7** before any state-asserting commit (`git log -5` + read newer mailbox events); **explicit pathspec** (`-m` before `--`); subagents use `env -u GIT_INDEX_FILE`.
- **Flag-before-burn (Rule #22):** before running a paid script, get non-author review first (`docs/protocol/claude/director-operator.md §Rule #22`).
- **Secondary sweep before closing a verdict:** after the primary rule, always check (a) role-partition, (b) lock implications, (c) recovery-path authorization, (d) signal-type correctness — an agent that nails the primary rule tends to skip these.

## Rationalizations — STOP

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'm the operator (not author here), so I can verify." | Eligibility is non-authorship. If you authored it, you can't verify it. |
| "I wrote the fix but it's green — I'll GO it." | You're the author. Director proxies the verification. |
| "Nits were cosmetic, upgrade NITS→GO." | Read the nit-fix diff first (§6c). "Cosmetic" is a claim. |
| "`release-lock` covers the same-commit rule." | No — separate `unlock` commit. `git rm` + GO in one commit. |
| "The director said it's done." | Author self-judgment ≠ GO. |
| "I read the diff the director pasted in chat." | Run `git show` yourself — a pasted diff is director-controlled; independence is lost. |
| "I'll tell the director in chat." | Binding signals are mailbox artifacts (Rule #19). |
| "New commit landed — I'll run a full Lane V." | Check the phase first. `docs`/`chore`/`test`/`style` → Lane D or ignore, not Lane V. |
| "STATE.md says 0 unread." | Stale cache. Recompute live (`seat_status.py` / cursor-vs-filenames), Rule #20. |
| "I'll send the verdict once the full report is written." | If a billed resource is running and the peer is blocked, send GO/NO-GO first (Rule #21). |

## Red flags (self-check)

- About to verify a fix you authored → you're the author; hand to the director proxy.
- Issuing GO without having read the diff (or, for NITS, the nit-fix diff) → guarantee #3 breach.
- Reviewer prompt cites the director's findings → contaminated; cold-context only.
- Releasing a lock in a separate commit from the GO → §6b atomicity.
- GO on a CRITICAL cross-cutting diff without checking it matches the co-signed brief scope → scope-drift FAIL missed.
- Firing Lane V on a `docs`/`chore` commit, or staying silent on a `fix` → phase misread.
- Citing an unread count or a GO-backing number you didn't recompute/reproduce → Rule #20 / R-MEASURE.
